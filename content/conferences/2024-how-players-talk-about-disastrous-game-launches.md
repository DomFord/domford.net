<i>Cities: Skylines</i> (Colossal Order, 2015) took the city-builder throne from Maxis’ <i>SimCity</i> series (1989–2014) after the disastrous launch of the fifth SimCity (Maxis Emeryville, 2013). But history may be repeating itself, as developers Colossal Order and publishers Paradox Interactive are facing a backlash to the launch of the hotly anticipated <i>Cities: Skylines II</i> (2023).

While studies have been conducted into games which had poor launches, like <i>No Man’s Sky</i> (Hello Games, 2016; see Chien et al., 2020) and <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> (CD Projekt Red, 2020; see Siuda et al., 2023), these focus on the games’ celebrated turnarounds, rather than on the period of the launch itself. The extensive cost of game development means a single failure can be catastrophic, as evidenced by <i>SimCity</i> developer Maxis Emeryville being shut down as a consequence of the poor launch. Yet these events seem to be becoming an increasingly common occurrence.

Here, I analyse a snapshot of player reaction and discourse to <i>Cities II</i>’s launch. 30 threads have been scraped from the subreddit /r/CitiesSkylines2 and coded using an open coding approach based on grounded theory (Gibbs, 2018, p. 67) to build a picture of themes of player speculation regarding why the launch was poor.
