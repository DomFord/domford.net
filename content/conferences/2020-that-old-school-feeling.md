What is 'old school' about <i>Old School RuneScape</i>? In this presentation, I discuss the history of the MMORPG <i>RuneScape</i> and the steps that led to Jagex in 2013 releasing a version of the game from 2007, titled <i>Old School RuneScape</i>, alongside their flagship iteration of the MMO, <i>RuneScape 3</i>. Through a lens of myth, I argue that a communal process of mythmaking is at the heart of <i>Old School</i> as players debate with each other and with the developers over the correct way to retrive the nostalgic object and lost time of <i>RuneScape</i> circa 2007.
