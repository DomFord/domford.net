In Scholar’s Codex, academics from around the world have come together to explore the themes, lore and ruined majesty of classics like Bloodborne, Dark Souls and Elden Ring. These are games that are defined by their depth and mystery. The result is a book that’s engaging and accessible to readers outside of academia, while travelling straight to the heart of the richest imaginative territory in all of video games.
