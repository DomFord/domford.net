I'm delighted to have been [longlisted for the Enter Award 2024](https://enter-award.irights-lab.de/longlist/)!

The Enter Award is run by [the independent think thank iRights.Lab](https://irights-lab.de/en/) and funded by the [Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/en/home/home_node.html). Its aim is to honour outstanding achievements in the field of open access, helping to advance the cause of the democratisation of knowledge. It's the first time an award of this kind has been set up in Germany.

There are five categories: Cooperation, Infrastructure, Transfer of Skills, Pioneering Achievement and Young Talent. I'm thrilled to have been longlisted for the Young Talent category.

I'm managing editor for [*gamevironments*](https://journals.suub.uni-bremen.de/index.php/gamevironments/) and an editor for [*Eludamos*](https://eludamos.org/index.php/eludamos), both [diamond open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access) publications within game studies. It's a privilege to work with these journals, because diamond open access is so important. The big publishers like Sage and Elsevier are a parasite on academia. They gatekeep knowledge and exploit those who make it, but many are forced to publish for them due to national and international infrastructures like points systems and the prestige of writing for certain journals published by them. If academia is to have a sustainable future, it is in diamond open access. I'm delighted to play a small role in that.

A huge congratulations to the other longlistees, who are great company to be in. They are all helping the push to open access and deserve credit for it.
