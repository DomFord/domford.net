# *Scholar's Codex*: Preorders now live!
A collection of essays on the *Souls* games written by academics from at least three continents. Each chapter takes its starting point from an item in one of the Souls games to talk about existentialism, humanity, irony, disempowerment, time and more.

Me and my co-editors, [Stefano Gualeni](https://gua-le-ni.com/), [Nele Van de Mosselaer](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/n-vandemosselaer) and [Daniel Vella](https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/danielmvella), have been working on this for a while, and keeping it secret has been hard. But now it's out there and you can all share in the excitement. Congratulations and thanks to all contributors.

Usually, this project would have been another edited collection with Routledge, or a special issue. But we wanted to do something a bit different, and to look a bit more outwards. We think that FromSoftware fans are particularly hungry for analysis and interested in the ideas dealt with in the games.

We felt that there was no reason that these chapters couldn't be both short and engaging *and* genuine contributions to scholarship. And, with the amazing work of [Tune & Fairweather](https://www.tuneandfairweather.com/), [Nico Delort](https://www.nicolasdelort.com/) and [Mark Wynne](https://www.markwynnedesign.com/), a beautiful object, too. We hope you enjoy!
