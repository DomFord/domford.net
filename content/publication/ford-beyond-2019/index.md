abstract: The cities of the ever prevalent neomedieval fantasy roleplaying game are
  integral to their gameworlds. They act as quest hubs, goals, centres for action
  and places of safety. Much of the loop of the game revolves around leaving the city
  to complete quests, then returning to the city again, and repeat. In this paper,
  I take a closer look at the boundaries of the city. I begin by proposing a model
  to help define what a cityâ€™s boundary is and how it is expressed to the player.
  Then, I look at how and why players cross those borders back and forth. Through
  this, I hope to facilitate a better understanding of how the city functions in roleplaying
  games, and how the ways in which it produces boundaries alters and affects how players
  interact with the gameworld.
