abstract: 'The relationship between humankind and technology is fundamental, but also
  a longstanding source of unease, particularly as that relationship has become ever
  more intimate and irreversible. In this paper, I connect this age-old anxiety with
  the age-old figure of the giant, a monster similarly intertwined with ancient questions
  on the boundaries of humanity. I focus on two examples: the Human-Reaper larva in
  Mass Effect 2 and Liberty Prime in Fallout 3 and 4. Although different in approach,
  these examples demonstrate a use of a phenomenon I call the ‘techno-giant’ to explore
  and reflect the powerful anxieties in our cultures to do with the future of the
  human– technology relationship. In particular, both examples expose the human–nonhuman
  boundary as being exceeding difficult to define and place, despite a constant desire
  to. The figure of the giant offers a powerful focal point for these representations.'
