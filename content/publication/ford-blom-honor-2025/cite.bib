	abstract = {We analyse the depiction of the Mongol invaders in Ghost of Tsushima (Sucker Punch Productions, 2020) through the lens of monstrosity, showing how their depiction is used as a frame to construct a notion of “pure” Japanese identity. To underscore how the Japanese in the game are “pure,” the Mongols are dehumanized and made monstrous through various devices, such as a language barrier, a collection of cultural Mongol artefacts, and their brute force as invaders polluting the established community. Positioned between the categories of “pure” and the “monstrous” is the player character, Jin, a liminal figure who blurs these two categories. Highlighting these depictions of the Japanese, nature, the Mongols and Jin, we consider how the construction of a pure Japan works in favour of bolstering the country’s national reputation.},
