abstract: What is ‘old school’ about Old School RuneScape? In this presentation,
  I discuss the history of the MMORPG RuneScape and the steps that led to Jagex
  in 2013 releasing a version of the game from 2007, titled Old School RuneScape,
  alongside their flagship iteration of the MMO, RuneScape 3. Through a lens
  of myth, I argue that a communal process of mythmaking is at the heart of textitOld
  School as players debate with each other and with the developers over the correct
  way to retrive the nostalgic object and lost time of RuneScape circa 2007.
