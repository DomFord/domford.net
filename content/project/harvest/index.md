Project made for Gameworld Design class at the IT University of Copenhagen.

Explore a mysterious hollow world from the inside as you learn why the world is the way it is.

I contributed with **narrative design**, **worldbuilding** and **design**. I also wrote and put together the art bible.

Download the game [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgoobYV4aSxhi8BbZUbokovel-gl6w?e=eTSJm9) and the art bible [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AgoobYV4aSxhi8Bc6kk-LNv379tQ4w?e=qjaEPZ).
