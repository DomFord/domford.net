Prototype made during the Game Prototyping class at the IT University of Copenhagen.

_Keeper_ features a dark world. Your castle is the only source of light and has a defined radius. Explore, kill enemies and bring back loot to expand your castle's light radius, allowing you to explore more of the world.

Move with WASD, attack with E, jump with SPACE.
