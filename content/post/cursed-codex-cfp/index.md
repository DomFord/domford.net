**Publisher:** [Tune & Fairweather](https://www.tuneandfairweather.com/)

# Call for chapters

We invite chapters of **2–3,000 words** on critical, theoretical and philosophical approaches to *Souls* games, written for a **nonspecialist, enthusiast audience**. Each chapter must use a **specific item and its description from a *Souls* game** as a starting point.

Authors of successful submissions will be **paid a flat rate** (TBD). The chapters are selected by the editors and are not peer-reviewed. The deadline for submission is **15 September 2024**. Submit as docx or pdf to [souls@domford.net](mailto:souls@domford.net).

For more details, see the call below, also attached as a pdf. You are strongly encouraged to contact one of the editors if you are thinking of submitting.

## Detailed call

*The Cursed Codex* (working title) is an **accessible collection of academic essays on the FromSoftware *Souls* videogames**: ***Demon’s Souls***, the ***Dark Souls*** series, ***Bloodborne***, ***Sekiro*** and ***Elden Ring***. Each essay takes an item and its cryptic description from one of the games as its starting point, using it to talk about the games from theoretical, philosophical and critical perspectives.

FromSoftware have proven one of the games industry’s most reliably acclaimed studios, at least since *Demon’s Souls* in 2009. From the *Dark Souls* series to *Bloodborne* to *Sekiro* to *Elden Ring*, each game’s release has been something of a cultural phenomenon. This is particularly the case for *Elden Ring*, FromSoftware’s most commercially successful game to date. The games have been popular enough to spawn a genre named after them: the Soulslike.

The games are also known for having particularly dedicated players and fans, who pore through item descriptions and explore every hidden corner to collectively understand these gameworlds. Because of this, books on the series, such as *You Died* (MacDonald and Killingsworth 2016; 2024) and *Beyond the Grave* (Mecheri and Sylvain 2017; 2018), have typically been more successful than similar books about other games.

Both the games and their fans have proven rich pickings for researchers. Work on FromSoftware games has approached them from angles including the ludic sublime (Vella 2015), myth (Ford 2024), the implied designer (Van de Mosselaer and Gualeni 2020), fan labour and lore (Ball 2017), storytelling and narrative (Andriano 2024; Caracciolo 2024; Hoedt 2019), surveillance (van Nuenen 2016), archaeology (Smith Nicholls and Cook 2022), difficulty (Robinson, Czauderna, and Von Gillern 2023; Terrasa Torres 2022), the gothic (Gama and Garcia 2019; Langmead 2017; Mukherjee 2024) and more.

Working with **Tune & Fairweather**, we will produce a **luxurious, illustrated book** that will be a stunning object in itself. It will *look* and *feel* like a ‘cursed codex’. The rough template for our project with T&F is their recent title [*Blood Echoes: A Bloodborne Anthology*](https://www.tuneandfairweather.com/products/blood-echoes-a-bloodborne-anthology) (Parkin 2023).

Our goal is to bring together scholars working on FromSoftware games from many different perspectives in an **accessible, public-facing, commercial volume**. There have been a number of essay anthologies on FromSoftware games, but so far none have included the perspective of academics. We think that fans and players of FromSoftware games would be especially receptive to scholarly approaches.

Authors will be **paid a flat rate** for their contributions, and each chapter will be accompanied in print by **specially commissioned artwork** from the large network of artists T&F are in regular contact with.

The timeline is fairly tight, as the plan is for the volume to be **content-ready before the end of 2024**, aiming at a **Spring 2025 launch**, with books in hand by Summer 2025. We are aiming for **15–25 chapters** in all.

After the submissions deadline (15 September), we will work with the selected authors to produce a final draft in time for our content-ready deadline at the end of 2024. Chapters that are ready early can be passed onto the publisher early so that the illustration process can be done on a rolling basis.

## Style

The bulk of the copyediting will of course be done after acceptance, but to help prepare your submission, especially in terms of writing style and tone, here is a brief styleguide. Some of these are preferences of our publisher, others are simply to help give the book a more cohesive tone.

- Use **American English**.

- Your chapter **must begin with your chosen item and item description**. An item is anything which can be found in the inventory and which has an accompanying description. For example, “Kuro’s Charm: *Charm received from Kuro. Placed on the Wolf’s person in secret, after he lost his life in Hirata Estate and gained the power of Resurrection. The charm has protected the Wolf well, tempering his ordeals. To part with it would mean facing a path of hardship beyond that endured thus far.*” The Fextralife wikis for each game are a useful resource here (e.g., [Kuro’s Charm](https://sekiroshadowsdietwice.wiki.fextralife.com/Kuro's+Charm)).

- **Your chapter should be insightful, original and accessible.** We are *not* looking for an accessible summary of your already existing research, nor a dense piece of new-but-incremental synthetic work. It should be **grounded in scholarship**, but must also be **readable for nonspecialist enthusiasts** – people who are familiar with the games, but without academic knowledge or training.

- As a ballpark, use **no more than five academic references**. Pick one or two core theoretical, critical or philosophical concepts that you think both advances scholarship and sheds interesting new light on the games for nonspecialist enthusiasts.

- Where possible, **use an impersonal tone**.

- **Referencing and citation style:** insert a red numeral at the place of citation (as with a footnote or endnote, but not superscript and not inserted automatically via Word, for example). Like this.<span style="color:red">1</span> Then include a numbered list of references at the end of your submission corresponding to the numbers in text. These references should be formatted according to Chicago 17th edition guidelines. Like this:
  
  <span style="color:red">1</span>. Mukherjee, Hiranya. ‘“Fear the Old Blood”: The Gothicism of *Bloodborne*’. *Games
   and Culture* 19, no. 1 (2024): 94–115. https://doi.org/10.1177/15554120231155325.

These will be converted into footnotes and placed on the page with the citation in a way that fits with the illustrations.

## Submissions

Send draft chapters of **2–3,000 words** to [souls@domford.net](mailto:souls@domford.net). Accepting submissions between **1 June** and **<u>15 September 2024</u>**. Submissions sent after 15 September will not be considered.

Each chapter must begin with the **item and item description** it is to be based on.

Submissions **should not be anonymous**. Successful submissions are chosen by the editors and are **not peer-reviewed.**

*******

**You are strongly encouraged to get in touch with one of the editors** **if you are considering submitting**. We are happy to talk through potential topics and answer any questions you might have. It is also useful both for us and for you to know who is writing about what so that we can avoid as much as possible people writing about the same item. We will not be able to accept more than one chapter on the same item. We also want to ensure a good spread of items across the games.

**You do *not* have to be an ‘academic’ to submit**. This may seem counterintuitive based on the goal of this volume, but what we’re interested in is an academic *approach* with both flair and rigour. We also do not want to exclude those in more precarious or peripheral positions within academia, such as recent PhD graduates who do not yet have another position, academics who have left/are leaving for industry, master’s students, independent scholars, etc.

**For the purposes of this book, the *Souls* games refer to**:

- ***Demon’s Souls*** (2009a)
- ***Dark Souls*** (2011)
- ***Dark Souls II*** (2014)
- ***Bloodborne*** (2015)
- ***Dark Souls III*** (2016)
- ***Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice*** (2019)
- ***Elden Ring*** (2022)

This naturally includes **remakes**, **remasters**, **DLCs**, etc. of those titles, such as *Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin* (2015). However, it does *not* include other FromSoftware titles and series such as *King’s Field* (1994–2001), *Armored Core* (1997–2023) and *Déraciné* (2018). These other titles may be discussed, but only in the context of *Souls* games and the chapter’s focal item. For instance, a chapter on the Moonlight Greatsword might talk about intergame references and its appearance in *Armored Core* series and *Ninja Blade* (2009b).

We look forward to reading your submissions!
