The online role-playing game Runescape has been running since 2001. And it's still going strong. The old-school version, launched in 2013, currently boasts around 250,000 active players per month. In short: Runescape simply refuses to die!

This is due to the MMO's recipe for success: direct community involvement, unparalleled in the genre. Developer Jagex even let its community vote on monetization—with the expected result.

In this video report, Martin and Sebastian from Decode trace the success story—and also the critical aspects—of Runescape's success.
