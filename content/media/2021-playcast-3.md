When is a bunch of pixels an object rather than a picture of an object? Can I unpack these digital objects into a series of homes and apartments? Find out now, as we discuss Jesper Juul’s latest playable essay on videogame objects, and Witch Beam’s charming new game _Unpacking_. Hosted by Dom Ford and Paweł Grabarczyk.

This is the third episode of ITU Playcast, a podcast by the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen. Returning after a little while, we’re trying out a simple format: each episode, we have a chat about one academic paper and one game.
