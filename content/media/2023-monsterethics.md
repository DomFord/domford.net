The monsters we see in video games are usually antagonists that we destroy without remorse. But what is a monster and are there ethical questions that arise in relation to how they’re represented? In what ways can monsters utilize racist and sexist tropes in harmful ways? Can we treat a type of monsters as a race of pure evil?  And is there anything that monsters might do that is beyond the pale? We chat with Dom Ford about Monster Ethics!
