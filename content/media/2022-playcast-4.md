Ever wondered what’s going on with doors? We try to collect all the different doors in Stefano Gualeni’s recent playable essay, and talk about the sedentary VR escape-the-room spy game _I Expect You To Die 2_. Hosted by Dom Ford and Paweł Grabarczyk.

This is the fourth episode of ITU Playcast, a podcast by the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen. Each episode, we have a chat about one academic paper and one game.
