We discuss whether this is (or should be) the last generation of consoles, what the meaning and role of difficulty and adaptive difficulty is in games, and why _Soma_ (Frictional Games, 2015) is such an intriguing game from a philosophy of mind perspective. Hosted by Dom Ford, who is joined by Paweł Grabarczyk and Miguel González Duque.

This is the pilot episode for ITU Playcast, a podcast by the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen. Each episode, a few of us get together to discuss both popular topics in the world of games, as well as what we’re working on in our research.
