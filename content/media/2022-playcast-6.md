The Hero’s Journey has been overused and abused in videogame writing for decades. We discuss Stephanie C. Jennings’ tracing of the authoritarian heart of the monomyth from a reading of _Horizon Zero Dawn_ to GamerGate. We also talk about one of the most hyped games of the last few months, the cyberpunk cat game _Stray_.

Hosted by Dom Ford and Paweł Grabarczyk.

This is the sixth episode of ITU Playcast, a podcast by the Center for Digital Play at the IT University of Copenhagen. Each episode, we have a chat about one academic paper and one game.
