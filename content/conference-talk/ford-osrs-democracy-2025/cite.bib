	abstract = {I examine player attitudes towards OSRS’ voting system and what this may entail for the potential future of player democracy in other contexts. I do this via a qualitative content analysis following Udo Kuckartz and Stefan Rädiker (2023). I will scrape the comment trees of 20 relevant threads in the game’s quasi-official forum, the subreddit /r/2007scape, and inductively code the posts. This will establish a number of themes, strands of thinking regarding how players perceive the voting system and how they negotiate their position in the player democracy. The data will be gathered and coded in February and March 2025. The presentation will then consist of my preliminary analyses, broader theoretical considerations and the potential benefits and problems with player democracy more widely applied.},
