Computer games are essentially concerned with spatial representation and negotiation, and therefore the classification of a computer game can be based on how it represents or, perhaps, implements space. More than time (which in most games can be stopped), more than actions, events and goals (which are tediously similar from game to game) and unquestionably more than characterization (which is usually nonexistent), games celebrate and explore spatial representation as a central motif and raison d'\^etre. In terms of playability, themes, tasks, subgenres and dramatic structure, nothing much has changed over the last two decades. The innovation takes place in spatial representation, and the genre's more slowly evolving complexity in the other areas (such as physical simulation) can be seen as a result of the increasing complexity of the spatial representation.},

In order to do so, the author distinguishes between fictions, representations, props, and metaphors in order to defend what the author refers to ``ludo-realism'' (the view that, in at least some classes of simulations, the underlying functional game elements of those simulations are real in a metaphysically robust sense). While games that rely substantively on a player's imagination (as in role-playing games) may contain fictive elements, other games (like chess) do not depend on any specific set of representational components. Such games and game elements are genuinely real. In arguing for this position, the author provides historical context for David Chalmers' most recent defense of a similar position that Chalmers refers to as digitalism. The author provides a helpful framework, through ludo-realism, in order to distinguish when, and why, some aspects of game objects are real (the operational), why some are virtual (e.g., simulated physiology), and why some can be fictional or documentary.},

In this article, I explore the relation between such media content and cross-media production. Furthermore, I critically discuss the implications for cultural theory and present a model of cross-media content transfer. The model shows what must be left behind in content--concept migrations across media, and presents the role and importance of games as a nexus in this exchange. I conclude that cross-media transfer happens relatively smoothly between forms that are alike, such as books and films, but less so between forms that have strong structural differences.},

Not much critical attention has been paid to the concept of fiction when applied to games and game worlds, despite many books, articles and papers using the term, often in the title. Here, it is argued that game worlds and their objects are ontologically different from fictional worlds; they are empirically upheld by the game engine, rather than by our mind stimulated by verbal information. Game phenomena such as labyrinths, moreover, are evidence that games contain elements that are just as real as their equivalents outside the game, and far from equal to the fictional counterparts.},

  abstract = {For half a century, digital machines have lent their computational power to mediate text-based, diegetic worlds, in the shape of software that we call games, video games, or sometimes interactive fiction. Perhaps the first such was Gregory Yob's simple labyrinth-monster game               Hunt the Wumpus               (1973), but ever since then the games (if that is what they should be called) have become larger and far more complex, and, in recent decades, a single such work can contain more text than, say, Shakespeare's collected plays. Given this massive textual content, as well as the often experimental and innovative nature of these works, they can also be considered a new form of novel; a kind of text that has much more in common with literature than with other digital games such as               Candy Crush Saga               ,               Age of Empires               or               Counterstrike               . In these `games', we find complex characters, difficult ethical choices (left to the player), imaginative landscapes and mythologies, and thousands if not millions of lines of carefully crafted prose. Teams of writers work collectively to stich these textual universes together, under production conditions that might remind us of multi-season TV series, but which are structured and consumed very differently -- in fact, more like literature than TV. The claim made in this article is that the perspective of the novel (or supernovel) is a productive one for understanding the nature of these artistic works of ludic software. Should they be considered Literature? Through a discussion of the notions of literature, novel, and fiction and through a close ludic reading of               Fallout: New Vegas               (2010) I will argue that these textual games are in fact Literature, a new kind of novelistic genre, and discuss the wider cultural implications of this assessment.},

This paper introduces a meta-model, which in addition to being an ontological model of its own, also offers a method for comparison between competing or isolated models and concepts. It does so by treating games as mechanisms (Craver 2007) with multiple levels of description, and differentiates between four main layers of the game-mechanism. In the first part of the paper we present the model in detail. In the second part of the paper we show applications of the model - we present how some of the existing approaches to game ontology can be compared within it and how it can be used to describe two case examples: the ancient Egyptian funeral game Senet and the difference between game mechanics and game rules.},

  abstract = {The study of game aesthetics is a very recent practice, spanning less than two decades. Unlike game studies in mathematics or the social sciences, which are much older, games became subject to humanistic study only after computer and video games became popular. This lack of persistent interest might seem odd, but only if we see traditional games and computer games as intrinsically similar, which they are not. We might try to explain this lack by noting that games are usually seen as trivial and low-brow by the aesthetic and theoretical elites who cultivate the analysis of artistic media objects: literature, the visual arts, theatre, music, etc. But this does not explain the fact that aesthetic studies of games are now possible, and even, in some academic environments, encouraged and supported with grants. What happened to cause this change? A better explanation could be that these games, unlike traditional games or sports, consist of non-ephemeral, artistic content (stored words, sounds and images), which places the games much closer to the ideal object of the Humanities, the work of art. Thus, they become visible and textualizable for the aesthetic observer, in a way the previous phenomena were not.},

  abstract = {Concerns about problematic gaming behaviors deserve our full attention. However, we claim that it is far from clear that these problems can or should be attributed to a new disorder. The empirical basis for a Gaming Disorder proposal, such as in the new ICD-11, suffers from fundamental issues. Our main concerns are the low quality of the research base, the fact that the current operationalization leans too heavily on substance use and gambling criteria, and the lack of consensus on symptomatology and assessment of problematic gaming. The act of formalizing this disorder, even as a proposal, has negative medical, scientific, public-health, societal, and human rights fallout that should be considered. Of particular concern are moral panics around the harm of video gaming. They might result in premature application of diagnosis in the medical community and the treatment of abundant false-positive cases, especially for children and adolescents. Second, research will be locked into a confirmatory approach, rather than an exploration of the boundaries of normal versus pathological. Third, the healthy majority of gamers will be affected negatively. We expect that the premature inclusion of Gaming Disorder as a diagnosis in ICD-11 will cause significant stigma to the millions of children who play video games as a part of a normal, healthy life. At this point, suggesting formal diagnoses and categories is premature: the ICD-11 proposal for Gaming Disorder should be removed to avoid a waste of public health resources as well as to avoid causing harm to healthy video gamers around the world.},

As an alternative, we propose a descriptive model of the definable supercategory that games belong to, cybermedia, that is pragmatic, open, and capable of meeting the needs of the diverse, intensely interdisciplinary field of game studies for a uniting conceptuallization of its main phenomenon. Our approach, the Cybermedia model, consisting of Player, Sign, Mechanical System, and Material Medium, offers a medium-independent, flexible and analytically useful way to contrast different approaches in games research and to determine which aspect of the phenomenon one is talking about when the word `game' is used.},

This study employed the WarpPLS 5.0 software to perform the Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis. The results of the measurement model on playful-consumption experience and consumer video game engagement support that both imaginal and emotional experience and cognitive, affective and behavioural engagement were reliable and valid as second-order formative constructs. Moreover, the findings of the structural model support that playful-consumption experiences such as imaginal, emotional, and sensory experience positively influence the prediction of cognitive, affective and behavioural states of consumer video game engagement. This study pioneers the field of digital game studies that have empirically validated a conceptual model predicting multiple states of the player's engagement in video game playing that is triggered through various playful experiences of a digital game. \copyright{} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.},

In addition, competitive video game play predicted higher levels of aggressive affect over time, which, in turn, predicted higher levels of aggressive behavior over time, suggesting that aggressive affect was a mechanism of this link.

This increasing diversity of representations remains rife with problems, however, ranging from the privileging of female queer identity over male queer identity in much of the Mass Effect series, to the ``gay button'' issue of having queer content only accessible through player effort to locate it. In order to examine both this progress and its problems, this article primarily uses close readings of game texts including the Mass Effect series, supplemented by key existing critical work on in-game sexuality (Consalvo, 2003; Shaw, 2009; Greer, 2013). The article begins with an application of Adrienne Rich's concept of ``compulsory heterosexuality'' to game worlds and examines the privileging of certain sexual activities and identities in games using Gayle S. Rubin's concept of the ``charmed circle''. Both of these concepts are applied to games more generally, and then to the work of game development studio BioWare particularly with a focus on their Mass Effect series. This article concludes with a consideration of some work by independent developers that both expand and critique the hierarchies of sex and what the mainstream game development community could learn from these projects.},

These strengths of the program also facilitate learning about the complex, dynamic, and interrelated nature of urban problems. Students are highly motivated to use the software because of its game-like aspects, yet after using the program they report attitudinal learning in the form of a greater appreciation of the role of urban planners, designers, and policy-makers. Instructors should consider how to accommodate different levels of previous experience with the software, particularly in relation to a gender-based dichotomy that is indicated by this study. In addition, instructors should consider how to respond to the more critical response of students who have a stronger background in geography and urban studies.},

  abstract = {The fall of 2016 saw the release of the widely popular First World War video game Battlefield 1. Upon the game's initial announcement and following its subsequent release, Battlefield 1 became the target of an online racist backlash that targeted the game's inclusion of soldiers of color. Across social media and online communities, players loudly proclaimed the historical inaccuracy of black soldiers in the game and called for changes to be made that correct what they considered to be a mistake that was influenced by a supposed political agenda. Through the introduction of the theoretical framework of the `White Mythic Space', this book seeks to investigate the reasons behind the racist rejection of soldiers of color by Battlefield 1 players in order to answer the question: Why do individuals reject the presence of people of African descent in popular representations of history?},

  abstract = {In 21st century, one of the prominent learning tool in the education industry is highlighted as Educational games (EG). There are many ways in which the literature describes its importance in the current generation. In addition, the learning environment, the rules embedded in the game, the theoretical aspects on which the game is built, and the learners/subject-matter experts; all play a crucial role in EG. Hence, this requires a projecting need of understanding the relationships that allows an enhancement in the learning objectives for learners while interacting through the game environment. Although, relationships are vaguely dispersed in literature; understanding the need to interrelate other concepts of game environment with learner's expectations, and how the elements of game environment interact throughout the play is essential. Therefore, this article highlights the proposed multi-domain framework for game developers to effectively map the game elements while extracting implicit vaguely supported relationships based on game environment domain and learner's concepts through a systematic literature review. Consequently, this article explains on twelve (12) implicit relationships in perspective of game environment domain and learners. They are validated through qualitative interviews with eight (8) game-based learning experts. Subsequently, the results are interpreted in relevancy with all domains of proposed framework by applying interpretive hermeneutic approach, and using NViVO software to obtain the themes, sub-themes, and coding strategy was adopted to code the expert's response with each relationship and its elements. The findings conclude twelve (12) explicit relationships between game environment domain and the learner's relationships; for game developers to guide them through the development phase of EG. \copyright{} 2005 -- ongoing JATIT \& LLS.},

  abstract = {The years succeeding 1990 have seen a significant increase in the release of mainstream film featuring transgendered characters. The inclusion of such characters in popular film becomes a point of interest as transgendered identities differ from the hegemonic heterosexism of the audiences at whom these films are targeted. This investigation aims to gain a better understanding of how audience members read gendered identity through the visual appearance of drag queen characters in mainstream film. Due to the emblematic contrast between the male body and a hyper-feminine dress aesthetic, drag queens pose an overt visual challenge to the normative expectation of anatomical sex determining gender and gendered expression. This investigation is conducted from the paradigmatic perspective that recognises the impossibility of a 'correct' reading of dress aesthetics and is thus concerned with discovering the various gendered meanings audience members may attach to drag costume in film. This interpretivist standpoint, however, is held in conjunction with the critical understanding that prevalent contemporary socio-political constructs with regard to gender and dress will undoubtedly affect these perceptions. Segments from selected films featuring drag queen protagonists were screened for a heterogeneous focus group and the subsequent discussion analysed through critical discourse analysis. Academic discourse concerning the socially constructed gender dichotomy and the debated subversive potential of the drag act is reviewed in order to provide a theoretical framework for analysing the participants' comprehension of gendered performance. Gendered associations with dress; the body; and film theory are examined to better understand how audience members may perceive gendered identity through drag costume in film and what affect this may have on their conception of sartorial gendered expressions in social reality. Finally, to situate and provide further context for this investigation, queer theory critiques of the representation and reception of transgendered characters in past mainstream films are considered. \copyright{} Inter-Disciplinary Press 2016.

This irreducibility between image and text will also be a key point of departure for examining the figure of the pirate as an affective/abjective/monstrous construction, rather than simply a discursive/textual one.},

In online multiplayer games, there is room for an extensive amount of user-created content working within the larger frame provided by the game design. However, games still set up a framework of indispensable rules and conditions, and studying these can help point out the underlying ideological constructions inherent in games that are challenged, reproduced or modified in the process of user creativity. Specifically, I am interested in the construction of gender that arises in this meeting (both in the sense of collaboration and of confrontation) between the game as designed structure and the player/user, and I propose using the cyborg image or ``myth'' as presented by Donna Haraway (Haraway, 1991) to shed light on the dynamics and theoretical implications of the complex of player, game and gender identity.},

A significant portion of these texts deal with Professor Severus Snape, the stern Potions Master with ambiguous ethics and loyalties. This paper explores a small community of Snape fans who have gone beyond a narrative retelling of the character as constrained by the work of Joanne Katherine Rowling. The `Snapewives' or `Snapists' are women who channel Snape, are engaged in romantic relationships with him, and see him as a vital guide for their daily lives. In this context, Snape is viewed as more than a mere fictional creation. He is seen as a being that extends beyond the Harry Potter texts with Rowling perceived as a flawed interpreter of his supra-textual essence. While a Snape religion may be seen as the extreme end of the Harry Potter fandom, I argue that religions of this nature are not uncommon, unreasonable, or unprecedented. Popular films are a mechanism for communal bonding, individual identity building, and often contain their own metaphysical discourses. Here, I plan to outline the manner in which these elements resolve within extreme Snape fandom so as to propose a nuanced model for the analysis of fandom-inspired religion without the use of unwarranted veracity claims.},

Central to the HLD is idea that hero narratives fulfill both epistemic and energizing functions. Hero stories provide epistemic benefits by providing scripts for prosocial action, by revealing fundamental truths about human existence, by unpacking life paradoxes, and by cultivating emotional intelligence. To energize us, heroes promote moral elevation, heal psychic wounds, inspire psychological growth, and exude charisma. We discuss the implications of our framework for theory and research on heroism, leadership processes, and positive psychology.},

I provide a framework for analyzing games that seek to present a diversity of perspectives, and to allow players to access modes of thinking that accord with a perspective other than their own.

Secondly, how are the middle ages presented in modern media and why do inaccuracies emerge and persist in these works? Thirdly, how do creators of modern content attempt to produce authentic medieval environments, and what are the benefits and pitfalls of accurate portrayals? The result is nuanced study of medieval culture which sheds new light on the use (and misuse) of medieval history in modern media"--},

Butler (2013) argue that fact-checking should be condemned to the dustbin of history because the methods fact-checkers use to select statements, consider evidence, and render judgment fail to stand up to the rigors of scientific inquiry and threaten to stifle political debate. However, the premises upon which they build their arguments are flawed. By sampling from multiple ``fact-checking agencies'' that do not practice fact-checking on a regular basis in a consistent manner, they perpetuate the selection effects they criticize and thus undermine their own position. Furthermore, not only do their arguments suffer from overgeneralization, they fail to offer empirical quantification to support some of their anecdotal criticisms. This rejoinder offers a study demonstrating a high level of consistency in fact-checking and argues that as long as unambiguous practices of deception continue, fact-checking has an important role to play in the United States and around the world.},

The commercial media industry is heavily invested in the research and development of digital technologies used to create simulations, graphics, and virtual worlds, which are also essential to the networked protocols of military training and weapons systems. In addition, video games such as America's Army have been developed by the United States Armed Forces as recruitment tools. With advances in digital computer-based technologies, warthemed games make increasing claims to realism, authenticity and historical accuracy. Real war footage is frequently inserted into narratives and battlefield sequences. We compare the narratives of the experiences of gamers to narratives of recruits and soldier's experiences of war. Though war themed interactive games are taking simulated battlefields to higher levels of realism, including more intense graphic violence, the thrilling excitement of entertainment replaces the emotional truth of war, a trend with highly negative consequences.},

  abstract = {In this article, we argue that a predictive processing framework (PP) may provide elements for a proximate model of play in children and adults. We propose that play is a behavior in which the agent, in contexts of freedom from the demands of certain competing cognitive systems, deliberately seeks out or creates surprising situations that gravitate toward sweet-spots of relative complexity with the goal of resolving surprise. We further propose that play is experientially associated with a feel-good quality because the agent is reducing significant levels of prediction error (i.e., surprise) faster than expected. We argue that this framework can unify a range of well-established findings in play and developmental research that highlights the role of play in learning, and that casts children as Bayesian learners. The theory integrates the role of positive valence in play (i.e., explaining why play is fun); and what it is to be in a playful mood. Central to the account is the idea that playful agents may create and establish an environment tailored to the generation and further resolution of surprise and uncertainty. Play emerges here as a variety of niche construction where the organism modulates its physical and social environment in order to maximize the productive potential of surprise.},

Contemporaneously, interactive entertainment has evolved to the point at which near-realism can be portrayed in real time. This, taken alongside the immersive interaction in which the industry specialises, and the dramatic techniques of engagement employed by the latest documentary films suggests that we may be at the brink of a new cultural form: the interactive documentary. In this paper we discuss the form that interactive documentary might take, and the historical and cultural context into which it fits. We conclude by detailing the issues raised by the concept of the interactive documentary, and how the role of documentary maker as auteur is reconciled with the notion of a truly interactive pathway through such a production.},

  abstract = {In many video games, failure can be an indicator that you are, in some way, progressing (Juul, 2013). This is often through challenging content which may take multiple attempts to complete. In education failure can also be seen as an underpinning of learning. In this study, we investigate the influence of failure on thinking skills in an educational video game. We analyze gameplay patterns and surrounding discourse of 88 middle school students playing Virulent, an educational game designed to teach virology to investigate the role of level failures in learning. Participants were separated into groups of 3--4 to roleplay as scientists and engaged in discussions on how to stop a virus while playing Virulent. To investigate the role of failure in learning in our camp, gameplay data were analyzed for patterns in player level failures while discourse around level failures was analyzed for the development of sense making. The current work presents analyses showing that a higher number of failures before initial success at levels across the game predict greater learning gains than time on task measures. This finding is then tied to discourse that shows that after encountering failures, players were often led to group discussions on relevant game mechanics with embedded virology content. This suggests that initial failures at educational game levels may help initiate collaborative discourse that promotes understanding of the program learning goals. These findings are discussed through the lens of productive failure (Kapur, 2008) and implications for educational game design are explored.},

This study uses behaviorally-coded gameplay videos and data-driven retrospective interviews to investigate how players think about and respond to failure in Cuphead, a notoriously challenging ``run 'n gun'' platformer video game. Emergent patterns show a link between how psychologists measure reactions to failure, known as "mastery orientation" and in-game behaviors, predicting both higher or lower mastery orientation scores. Player interview responses also show a range of ways that players experience failure beyond hard-coded failure (losing health or dying), including poor performance in a section already completed, lack of progress, or giving up. This research deepens our understanding of the role failure plays in one of our most pervasive media, developing our understanding of how players experience failure and the behaviors they take in response.},

The article emphasizes the genre's features of safety, abundance, and softness, which create an atmosphere that soothes players amidst high-paced, contemporary lifestyles. While often framed as a type of resistant design, it is argued that cozy games uphold capitalist principles, by encouraging players to replicate them within the game. The discussion extends to the idea of coziness in interior design within these games, which is shown to reproduce ideologies of class, status, and consumerism. Drawing from atmosphere theory as well as the works of Jean Baudrillard, Slavoj \v Zi\v zek, and Richard Dyer, the author argues that even the act of designing cozy spaces in these games serves as a continuation of capitalism and that cozy games may be thought of as utopian entertainment attempting to answer societal shortcomings through capitalist solutions. Thus, the essay posits that while cozy games offer a respite, they reproduce the conditions sustaining capitalist modernity.},

The final, structured set of these tales for a given culture makes up that culture's mythology, and as we look back on any given mythos, we gain a new understanding of its values and principles. As we learn more of these stories, we often take them and update or borrow from them in a manner relevant to our current society. We can see this in a variety of modern media, ranging from reinvigorated Norse gods in Marvel comics to Hollywood blockbusters such as Troy or Beowulf. These stories ring true to use despite their age, and we seek them out time and time again to be drawn deeper into worlds steeped in millennia of storytelling. This chapter will examine the incorporation of mythology and lore into the narrative structure of Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMOs), and how the depth of lore contributes to the player experience. Specifically, the chapter will investigate developer lore building and player-drive lore participation as they pertain to the classical formation of human mythology. It will further seek to understand the role of lore in the successful launch and sustainability of MMOs by looking at several high-profile games with varying levels of depth and public exposure.},

From these findings, it appears that, by SIMaging their ideal CITY, the Centro Tau youth have started to think about "civic" issues on a very concrete and practical level. Despite the strong affective ties they show towards their daily living context, they have lucidly identified its negative aspects and confronted themselves on the choices and solutions necessary for reinventing it as a better urban setting inspired by a vision for sustainable development.

This is a relevant issue in the videogame Dark Souls as the basic elements of its grammar, level design, gameplay mechanics and narrative, offer the player the experience of incompleteness in different ways.

  abstract = {Game design courses and programs have gained considerable ground on university campuses in recent decades, spurred by a cultural swerve toward digital gaming. Are there ways for these curricula, with their focus on practical experience and production, to discover an overlap with an existing body of scholarship that looks at games within religious contexts? One intriguing, if highly hypothetical, arrangement: a university design program focused on the creation of holy games, the subset of rite found, in one form or another, across traditions and in both historical and current practice. Examples of games that might fit this definition include the Mesoamerican ball game, sumo, the ancient Olympics and the hiding of the afikomen during the Seder. Because such games exist, it stands to reason that they were shaped by human hands. As religious traditions evolve, and new offerings and forms of practice are made continuously available, especially in digital contexts, is there value in having trained craftspeople who can deliver modern versions of holy games that are satisfying and fit for purpose? The paper looks at a syllabus of readings for such a program, in the unlikely event it should ever exist, drawing on an interdisciplinary coursework that includes ritual criticism, literature studies and ludic archeology.},

For instance, much of the viewership of Apex Legends streams --- it generated 8.28 million hours of collective spectator viewing in one day in early February, breaking Fortnite's records from the previous year --- was driven by live streaming ``influencers'' like Michael ``Shroud'' Grzesiek, who personally accrued nearly a million of those hours. Streamlabs, which makes broadcasting software for streamers, processed \$141 million in tips for live streamers in 2018, a 41 percent increase from the previous year. Put simply, live streaming has become a big entertainment business in its own right, and this changes the relation between streamers and spectators, feedbacking into gameplay itself.},

The Video Game Debate 2 draws from the latest research findings from the top scholars of digital games research to address these concerns. The book explores key developments such as virtual and augmented reality, the use of micro-transactions, the integration of loot boxes, and the growth of mobile gaming and games for change (serious games). Furthermore, several new chapters explore contemporary debates around e-sports, gamification, sex and gender discrimination in games, and the use of games in therapy.

What can World War Two strategy games teach us about the reality of this complex and multifaceted period? Do the possibilities of playing with the past change the way we understand history? If we embody a colonialist's perspective to conquer 'primitive' tribes in Colonization, does this privilege a distinct way of viewing history as benevolent intervention over imperialist expansion? The fusion of these two fields allows the editors to pose new questions about the ways in which gamers interact with their game worlds. Drawing these threads together, the collection concludes by asking whether digital games - which represent history or historical change - alter the way we, today, understand history itself"--},

  abstract = {The rise of blogging mothers as precariat workers conducting `playbour', a combination of play and labour, and as subjects of neoliberalism, requires a re-examination of virtually mobile mothers and their role in 21st century society. At the same time, public relations (PR) and marketing practitioners are grappling with how to interact and `work' with these, among other, social media influencers who are increasingly seen as able to sell products and ideas through their blogs, Instagram, Facebook and other social media platforms. The relatively new relationships between PR practitioners and social media influencers raise questions of unequal power and vulnerability for both the largely amateur influencers and the PR practitioners. The relationship between the two means that ethical questions around exploitation, authenticity, professionalism and control have arisen, with both sides feeling their way in new terrain. This article uses the concepts of precarity and liminality and applies them to a group of `mommy/mummy/mum bloggers', that is, blogging mothers of young children, negotiating their identities as mothers, and moving beyond their homes using social media to, in part, create a sense of belonging (but also, in some cases, to make money). The article is based on the author's own longitudinal digital ethnography within online influencer territory, and includes mainstream and online media reports and interviews with both mum bloggers and PR practitioners. It is argued that the marketisation of motherhood within a dominant culture of neoliberalism means that practitioners may wrongly assume that mum bloggers are acting freely to engage with entrepreneurial endeavours.},

  abstract = {The main social media platforms have been implementing strategies to minimize fake news dissemination. These include identifying, labeling, and penalizing --via news feed ranking algorithms-- fake publications. Part of the rationale behind this approach is that the negative effects of fake content arise only when social media users are deceived. Once debunked, fake posts and news stories should therefore become harmless. Unfortunately, the literature shows that the effects of misinformation are more complex and tend to persist and even backfire after correction. Furthermore, we still do not know much about how social media users evaluate content that has been fact-checked and flagged as false. More worryingly, previous findings suggest that some people may intentionally share made up news on social media, although their motivations are not fully explained. To better understand users' interaction with social media content identified or recognized as false, we analyze qualitative and quantitative data from five focus groups and a sub-national online survey (N = 350). Findings suggest that the label of `false news' plays a role --although not necessarily central-- in social media users' evaluation of the content and their decision (not) to share it. Some participants showed distrust in fact-checkers and lack of knowledge about the fact-checking process. We also found that fake news sharing is a two-dimensional phenomenon that includes intentional and unintentional behaviors. We discuss some of the reasons why some of social media users may choose to distribute fake news content intentionally.},

  abstract = {Digital  games  are  a  relatively  new  medium.  While  they  have  been  around  for  over half a century, they only became a major part of the culture relatively late. Like   every   other   medium   before,   games   also   have   struggled   to   find   an   expressive language of their own. Some of the expressive styles of other media are  still  relevant  for  games,  but  new  ones  have  to  be  created  specifically  for  videogames. This dissertation is a study of how ludonarrative videogames, videogames that  combine  game  elements  with  narrative  elements,  express  and  convey  meaning. This is done as part of game studies, a multidisciplinary approach to studying games. The purpose is twofold: to build a foundation for better under-standing  of  meaning-making  in  games,  and  to  provide  game  designers  with  tools for analyzing issues related to meaning. This  study  uses  philosophical  tools  to  analyze  meaning  in  games.  The  philosophical  hermeneutics  of  Hans-Georg  Gadamer  is  used  to  compare  the  meaning-making  in  games  to  the  interpretation  of  works  of  art.  The  theory  of  the interpretive process is based on the idea of the hermeneutic circle. Wittgen-stein's  concept  of  language-games  is  used  in  examining  how  games  should  be  defined  and  how  their  relations  to  each  other  should  be  understood.  These  philosophical methods are combined with the study of procedurality, narrativi-ty and players. This  study  shows  that  ludonarrative  games  are  procedural  systems  that  are interpreted both during gameplay and as a part of the surrounding cultural context.  The  result  of  this  interpretation  is  neither  predetermined  by  the  game  designer  nor  fixed  during  gameplay,  but  potentially  open  for  endless  reinter-pretation as players interact with the game in new ways and as the cultural con-text changes. In order to convey meaning, ludonarrative games can borrow ex-pressive tools from other media, for example by using perspective in the way it is used in cinema. Additionally,  this  study  provides  guidelines  for  designing  meaning.  It  is  shown how meaning can be used as a game mechanic, and how games contain unique ways of expressing things that would be hard to convey in other media.},

Based on an analysis of forum discussions, this empirical study illustrates how players utilize Hearthstone's restricted communication affordances for negative and insulting purposes, and how players negotiate their shared symbolic reality concerning this type of interaction, labeled "Bad Manner(s)" or "BM". The continuous debate over an issue which ultimately cannot be solved shows that players care deeply about the game and the surrounding culture. This study contributes to our understanding of player-to-player communication, and offers insight into game design from a social interaction point-of-view. By doing so, it connects with the larger questions of emergent negotiations of meaning related to human communication behavior in technology-mediated settings with designed limitations on communicative affordances.},

From the fire-breathing beasts of North European myth and legend to the Book of Revelation's Great Red Dragon of Hell, from those supernatural agencies of imperial authority in ancient China to those dragon-women posing a threat to male authority, dragons have a wide variety of forms and meanings. But there is one thing they all have in common: our fear of their formidable power and, as a consequence, our need to overcome them, to appease them or in some way to assume their power as our own. How can this be explained? Is it our need to impose order on chaos in the person of a dragon-slaying hero? Is it our terror of Nature unleashed in its most destructive form? Or is the dragon nothing less than an expression of that greatest and most disturbing mystery of all - our mortality? Martin Arnold traces the history of ideas about dragons, from the earliest of times to Game of Thrones, and asks what exactly it might be in our imaginations that appears to have necessitated such a creature},

This article describes the use of SimCity in the university course Infrastructure Management, which has been in continuous operation since 2002. Methodologically, a total of four events were observed. Students' motivation, the didactic scenario and the perceived learning outcomes were examined with the help of a focus group discussion and questionnaires. The didactic scenario shows characteristics not described in this combination in the literature to date: (1) the moderated open, simultaneous and competitive play in groups, (2) the used regional planning scenario and (3) the long, regular period of application of more than 15 years. The results show that SimCity 4 can still serve as a platform for exciting learning scenarios more than 15 years after its initial release. It could also be shown that the didactic scenario motivates the students and that SimCity also generates gaming fun. Furthermore, it could be argued that a regional scenario can be implemented by simple means and is perceived as motivating by the students. Furthermore, this study indicates that even a technically complex and fast-moving medium such as a computer game can be used in a didactic scenario over a longer period with limited effort. Nevertheless, the challenge of game aging should be actively addressed. Furthermore, the study revealed that game-based learning still faces challenges with being recognized by students as a serious learning activity.},

Opposed to the spatial metaphor of Huizinga's ``magic circle'' of gameplay, they conceptualize the partaking in a game as a cognitive frame, as an ongoing process. To cast off the implications of redundancy or stagnation contained in a circle, they resort instead to the figure of the spiral, which accounts for the gamer's progression through the game. Their gamer- and gameplay-centric model features three interconnected spirals which represent the cycles gamers have to go through in order to answer gameplay, narrative, and interpretative questions, in both heuristic and hermeneutic fashion. They also underscore the fact that gamers cannot access a game's algorithms directly and must instead construct an image of the game system, whose degree of fidelity towards the actual rules of the game may greatly vary (depending, for instance, if the gamer is playing to progress through the game, as opposed to playing to master the game mechanics).},

A new design, the Erkennungsmarke, was introduced in 1878, shaping the systems utilized in later wars. The German experience of wearing identifying objects would later influence the identification systems of other European armies, including France and Britain; ultimately resulting in the addition of new articles within the 1906 Geneva Convention to reflect changing attitudes and expectations towards those who died fighting for their country. The Erkennungsmarke presented the possibility of identification, even where immediate burial was not possible, thus facilitating the development of German military burial cultures. This paper explores the development and use of Erkennungsmarken between 1866--1918, information which can assist with the identification of German soldiers recovered during archaeological works.},

New studies with Portuguese students show conservative views towards gender roles and disinterest in prioritising diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), which contrasts with the global tendency to incorporate it in the industry. Lately, initiatives promoting DEI have populated the esports landscape. However, the communities' response, which may impact effectiveness, remains under-examined. This work is part of a larger ethnographic project that aims to understand how the esports communities in Portugal perceive and react to DEI initiatives such as women-only tournaments or harassment awareness campaigns. This paper will discuss findings from the thematic analysis of 10 interviews with Portuguese members of an esports community. The recurring themes were (1) DEI initiatives are imposed; (2) Portugal is too small to care (about DEI); (3) nepotism; (4) self-preservation; and (5) ubiquity of online toxicity.},

Nevertheless, they are rarely discussed in sociological debates about religion. Online gaming may temporarily invoke a `willing suspension of disbelief' but it can, given the fictitious nature of the text, never counter the secularization or disenchantment of Western culture. In this essay it is argued that the emphasis on (dis)belief in sociology creates a blind spot for `play' as an important  epistemological strategy to engage with religion. The ambivalent and transgressive nature of play, it is demonstrated, provides the opportunity for young players of World of Warcraft to experience spirituality without necessarily believing in supernatural claims; to fully immerse themselves in the `magic circle' without conversion to a pre-defined set of beliefs and to freely experiment with religious narratives without becoming a true believer.},

Instead of focusing on the much debated commodification of spirituality, this paper explores an unacknowledged spiritualization of commodities by using a case study of online computer games. It is demonstrated that World of Warcraft, the most popular in the genre of Massively Multi-Player Online Role-Playing Games, is marketed, framed and designed by the gaming industry as an other-worldly world of re-enchantment that provides distinctly spiritual experiences for individual players. Players, in turn, argue that playing the game provides deep insights into their "higher selves" and generates feelings of "supernatural agency"- assumptions that are at the heart of the contemporary spiritual milieu. Based on this affinity between the "spiritual" milieu and the "secular" gaming industry, it is argued that both are not separate domains but rather converge in, what can be called, the spiritual experience economy.},

However, I note the difficulties associated with framing psychosis as a conventional disability in theoretical discourse and call for the continued collaboration between the humanities and the medical sciences to promote scholarship that does not inadvertently perpetuate stigmatizing tropes. Lastly, I also argue for an active divestment of the term ``madness'' in the humanities and note the potential for videogame studies to establish a scholarly standard for doing so.},

Horizon Zero Dawn is the story of a young girl named Aloy who lives in a post-apocalyptic world in which humans were decimated by the robots they had created hundreds of years before. This article analyses the way in which, within the narrative, governments and corporations implemented their plan to ensure humanity's survival, and their justifications to lie to the general public about the lengths this plan would go to. This article examines how their justification for lying usurped the robots' claim to inherit the Earth and the ethics behind it.},

In this paper, we taxonomize several classes of failure in the player's experience, offering a diagnostic tool that distinguishes in-loop failures from out-of-loop failures. By classifying both games and specific failure instances, the Taxonomy of Failure extends present vocabularies for: game designers making design choices, scholars critiquing the usability of games, educators teaching games, data analysts segmenting players, and game developers creating more adaptive games.},

  abstract = {The Mythic Tales side quests in Ghost of Tsushima (2020) explore folkloric and supernatural narratives using the themes from legends and lore surrounding Tsushima Island. However, as a historical video game that reimagines a thirteenth-century medieval Japanese society during the events of the Mongol invasion of Japan in 1274, careful examination of its represented form is necessary since it can tell us how a player is instructed to play with the reimagined past or what about the past is deemed important (Chapman; Balela and Mundy; McCall). Furthermore, the side quests provide a deeper exploration of the game-world setting, which can provide a historical and sociocultural understanding of the represented past through gameplay. In line with this, this paper examines the Mythic Tales experience by exploring the representations of the in-game version of a Japanese traditional performance art called the heikyoku, performed by a medieval storyteller known as the biwa h\=oshi. This includes a discussion of the tradition and how it translates into a video game format, highlighting the special audiovisual spectacle that relies on familiar Japanese imageries such as the sumi-e and ukiyo-e, which are unique to this part of the game. A case study of one of the Mythic Tales, ``The Curse of Uchitsune,'' will serve as critical analysis toward the kind of in-game mythic narrative and experience the game provides.},

This seemingly technical question is shown to be primarily cognitive and conceptual: players draw on their real-life and fictional frames of reference in an ongoing epistemological process of situating themselves vis-\`a-vis gameworld and playable figure. The traditional metaphor for this relationship, that of a cyborg, neither captures the variety of relationships suggested by games, nor the range of interpretations open to players. To overcome this limitation, I propose six conceptual types, based on the significance that tools and vehicles have for the playable figure. I ask: is there a co-dependence between equipment and user, is it permanent, and do they have a metonymic relationship to each other? These abstract categories are shown to be connected to archetypical proto-narratives epitomized by characters from mythology and popular culture, which players implicitly refer to in conceptualizing their relationship to the gameworld. The essay, then, offers a framework for the conceptual variety of player-playable figure-relations, which, in drawing on cultural history, should be equally transparent to scholars of game studies and narratology.},

The article argues that Deathloop embodies the aesthetic sensibilities of metamodernism (Vermeulen and van den Akker, 2010), which are a continuation and reaction to modernist and postmodernist aesthetics. Metamodernism emphasizes indeterminacy, truthfulness and hopefulness, striving for more ethical and less cynical art in all media. The article analyzes the construction principles of the genre of immersive sim, and how Deathloop departs from its conventions, before introducing metamodernism as a theoretical backdrop for a hermeneutic analysis. The analysis correlates game structure, mechanics and narrative of Deathloop to illustrate how the game overcomes both the genre restrictions of immersive sims and the modern and postmodern sensibilities found in earlier games of a similar style.},

The article presents the performative discourse of blockchain advocates as well as the counterarguments presented by journalist, players, and developers, in order to demonstrate that arguments against cryptogaming are not anticapitalist and politicized, but mostly based on common sense. Then, the article investigates game studies concepts for their capacity to further explicate cryptogames, and finds that neither gamification nor playbor are completely fitting. Instead, the article turns to the game research fundamentals of Huizinga and Caillois to cast blockchain gaming in a new light. From this perspective, games like CryptoKitties and Axie Infinity emerge as nested activities that can be approached as play of financial speculation, with the latter approach being significantly privileged in existing games.},

And still, with all the relativism of the comparatist whose only creed is that there are always two (or more) ways of looking at any matter, I have become deeply fascinated with ecocriticism lately. Ecocriticism, the application of ecological thinking to humanism (and especially literary studies) developed in parallel with game studies, starting in the late 1970s and coming to real scholarly prominence in the mid- to late-1990s. I have been engaged in game studies since the late 1990s, and when I propose here to introduce a Greenshift into our field, it is not a moral, ideological, or philosophical argument I want to make, but merely a practical one: I am confident that the blend of ecological ideals and humanistic hermeneutics developed by ecocriticism holds great promise for game studies.},

Zombies have no soul or consciousness, and as completely alien, post-human Other, they seem like the perfect game opponent.

The paper explores the trope\quotedblbase s iconography and how it is used in a number of paradigmatic games, from Plants vs. Zombies and Call of Duty to the Resident Evil series, Left 4 Dead, Fallout 3 (the Tenpenny Tower quests) and DayZ.

  abstract = {Ecocriticism of digital games has so far engaged with a rather small corpus of examples, often prescriptively and with a quite limited methodological toolkit. This essay systematizes and historicizes some of these commonly found limitations of past research and proposes methods for a more historically and generically diverse exploration of ecological thinking vis-\`a-vis digital games. The majority of discussions of games from an ecocritical perspective has applied concepts and frameworks borrowed from literature and film studies, thus privileging surface semiotics over game mechanics. More methodically aware studies have oriented themselves toward the popular framework of procedural rhetoric (Bogost 2007), resulting both in a selection bias towards serious games and an author-centric, intentionalist slant inherent in the approach. In general, the discussion revolves around a small number of games with apparent ecocritical potential, such as Myst (Cyan 1993) or Farmville (Zynga 2009), resulting in a selective, a-historic and therefore distorted discussion of ecology in the diverse medium of digital games. This essay discusses strategies for dealing with a larger corpus of digital games through a descriptive matrix for identifying and analyzing the ecological dimension of digital games. It proposes an extension of the ecocritical toolkit by including a more user-centered, ethics-based theoretical framework based on Sicart's Ethics of Computer Games (2009). The gain of engaging with representation and simulation of the natural environment in mainstream computer game history will be demonstrated in an analysis of two paradigmatic games. In both Red Dead Redemption (Rockstar San Diego 2010) and Dishonored (Arkane Studios 2013), we encounter game design geared toward producing ludo-narrative dissonances which are highly inductive of critical engagement with the ecosphere.},

Much dissent stems from incompatible basic assumptions about play and narrative, which, this article argues, can be reconciled by a formalist approach to games and narrative on a structural level. First, event structures and story structures are shown to be central to various theories of narrative. Correlating these findings with Espen Aarseth's reflections upon nonlinearity, an understanding of narrative revolving around event logic is developed. Building on the theory of games developed by Roger Caillois, the article then develops a model of games in which three layers of structures are governed by three types of rules. The most abstract of these layers arranges game elements in a meta-structure which is based on both ludic and narrative logic. In a final step, nonlinear game structures are explained within this model and categorized in a typology that orders them by the type of agency players can execute.},

  abstract = {This article argues that Wolfenstein: The New Colossus, a AAA First-Person Shooter, is not only politically themed, but presents in itself a critical engagement with the politics of its genre and its player base. Developed at the height of \#Gamergate, the game is interpreted as a response to reactionary discourses about gender and ability in both mainstream games and the hardcore gamer community. The New Colossus replaces affirmation of masculine empowerment with intersectional ambiguities, foregrounding discourses of feminism and disability. To provoke its players without completely alienating them, the game employs strategies of carnivalesque aesthetics---especially ambivalence and grotesque excess. Analyzing the game in the light of Bakhtinian theory shows how The New Colossus reappropriates genre conventions pertaining to able-bodiedness and masculinity and how it ``resolves'' these issue by grafting the player character's head on a vat-grown Nazi supersoldier-body. The breaches of genre conventions on the narrative level are supported by intentionally awkward and punishing mechanics, resulting in a ludo-narrative aesthetic of defamiliarization commensurate to a grotesque story about subversion and revolt. Echoing the ritualistic cycle of death and rebirth at the heart of carnivalesque aesthetics, The New Colossus is nothing short of an ideological re-invention of the genre.},

Calling them``runes''is a conscious choice, meant toevoke a certain response in the audience. In digital games--that is, computerand video games--the use of runes appears to be widespread, but this use hasnot been studied closely. To runologists and Old Norse scholars, the use ofrunes in games can give an idea of how the general public understands therunic tradition. The context in which runes appear can also throw light onwhich characteristics of rune-using cultures--that is, Vikings--the developerswish to evoke.

In so doing it seeks to understand not only how the franchise functions but also how the objects in this franchise (particularly the non-human Pok\'emon creatures and trainers) work in tandem to connect audiences to very specifically Japanese ideas of the ``national imagination'' (folklore, spiritualism, the supernatural) and environmental concerns (biodiversity, the struggle between conservation and containment) through the larger consumerist framework of acquisition and play structured as cultural practice. In this way, it is argued, that the Pok\'emon object network functions as a gateway into Japanese culture more broadly and a channel through which Japanese culture is itself mainstreamed internationally.},

Such an ideology, simultaneously embracing both the conservation and consumption of nature, is emblematic of the larger challenges Japan has had to negotiate as a nation trying to balance economic development and environmental protection. In this way, this article argues that, when subjected to textual analysis, the Pok\'emon franchise can function as vernacular theory, interrogating the relationship between environmentalism, materialism and sustainable development, a series of popular youth media texts engaging with issues and subjects that are usually reserved for academia.},

  abstract = {This collected volume explores a novel approach to the intersection of artificial intelligence and the humanities, proposing that instead of merely writing about AI, scholars should think with AI. Rather than treating AI as an external subject of study, the essays explore how concepts from artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science can provide ways to rethink core humanistic questions of meaning, representation, and culture. Critical AI Studies typically focuses on AI's societal implications---its role in surveillance, exclusion, and global capitalism. This volume extends that critique, but also explores how AI brings our already existing understanding of aesthetics, language, history, and knowledge into relief and stands in an often productive conflict with them. AI's pattern recognition and generative capabilities, for example, provokes new ways to grasp aesthetic unity, reimagine language as an autonomous system, and reconsider the boundaries between text and image. The essays illustrate how AI can be used as a productive metaphor and intellectual tool for the humanities. From formalizing concepts like Stimmung and vibe to challenging traditional distinctions between writing and thought or between history and data, the book shows how AI can be not just an object of study but a conceptual catalyst that ignites unexpected connections to long-standing humanistic concerns. By engaging AI in this way, scholars can not only critique it but also expand the horizons of their own fields.

I argue that despite their prevalence in humanistic game studies, these metaphors widely conflate space topologies with aspects of representation, perspective, teleology, and sequentiality. One can rarely tell what specific aspects of the game are addressed by research on this subject. Indeed, labyrinths are ambiguous and highly connotative words, and as such they are unproductive for the classification of game space topology. This paper intends to facilitate more rigorous research on the subject, starting by building on clearly delineated elements of the game world.},

  abstract = {This article argues that unplayability must be a considered component of game analysis and further discussed in new media studies. The concept that games cannot be or should not be played does not limit game analysis. On the contrary, the ``unplayable aspect'' of a particular game or genre of games is what must be investigated. This essay hopes to expand upon why new media such as video games are becoming inaccessible by using Nicholas Baer et al.'s Unwatchable to discuss a range of unplayable games for common reasons such as: (1) excessive violence, (2) sexual violence, and (3) preservation issues.},

  abstract = {This article explores the relationship between surveillance capitalism, big data, and the emergence of a new type of datafied citizenship by looking at two different, yet interconnected, dimensions. In the first place, it considers how under surveillance capitalism individuals are being profiled simultaneously as consumer and citizen subjects by a complex political economic infrastructure that brings private and public entities together. In the second place, it argues that surveillance capitalism depends on the systematic coercion of digital participation, which forces citizens to comply with data technologies and give up their personal data. If we want to understand the extent of these transformation, the article argues, we need to look at children. Children have traditionally been excluded from debates about citizenship because they have often been understood as not-yet citizens or future citizens. Yet, in the study of the relationship between data and citizenship, children today are the key. They are the very first generation of citizens who are datafied from before they are born and are coerced into digitally participating to society through the data traces produced, collected, and processed by others without their consent or control. Drawing on the findings of the Child \textbar{} Data \textbar{} Citizen project, an ethnographically informed research project on big data and family life in the UK and US, this article will highlight some of the democratic challenges that emerge when we think about data, surveillance capitalism, and citizenship in everyday life.},

In doing so, the contribution also seeks to explore the complex relationship between AI-generated faces, including deep fakes, mourning, and posthumous rights. The article has five parts. In the introduction, we discuss the challenges of posthumous existence and the issues related to respecting the deceased. We also examine some examples of `digital personhood'. In part two, we present three case studies and use semiotics to help us distinguish between posthumous existence and digital resurrection. In part three, we provide a semiotic classification of representation in the context of digital faces and our case studies. We suggest that there is a difference between the phenomenological presence of a hologram and the cognitive value of recreating someone's identity, including their biography, face, and voice. In part four, we explore the topic of digital spectra and mourning, including the concept of imputability. In part five, we analyse how the law offers new insights into the ontology of the face of the deceased and posthumous existence in hologram form. In the conclusion, we summarise the article's key findings and highlight open issues and potential future developments.},

But from the perspective of philosophy of art this question was topsy turvey, since according to one of the most influential theories of representation all art is a game. Kendall Walton's prop theory explains how we interact with paintings, novels, movies and other artworks in terms of imaginary games, like a child's game of make-believe, wherein the artwork acts as a prop prescribing specific imaginings, and in this view there can be no question that games are indeed a strange and wonderful form of art. In Imaginary Games, game designer and philosopher Chris Bateman expands Walton's prop theory to videogames, board games, collectible card games like Pok\'emon and Magic: the Gathering, and tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons \& Dragons. The book explores the many different fictional worlds that influence the modern world, the ethics of games, and the curious role the imagination plays in everything from religion to science and mathematics.},

  abstract = {The discourses around games have tended to focus upon either their artefactual qualities or the phenomenological experience of play. In both cases, games are primarily to be understood singularly. An alternative approach, related to Foucault's archaeological methods, is to focus upon the manner in which games share player practices with earlier games. This technique can be applied to all eras of games, and is not merely restricted to videogames -- indeed, a significant proportion of the player practices of videogames descend directly from the player practices of tabletop games, especially in terms of the progenitive role of tabletop role-playing games for contemporary digital entertainment. Such player practices can be broadly understood in terms of interface (how the player engages with the game), world (what the player imagines is happening), or the agency practices that connect the interface and the world.Three propositions concerning the relationships between fictional setting and designed rule systems within games are explored, the last of which stresses the idea that `no-one plays alone' i.e. that all play entails continuity of its practices over and above variation of those practices. These propositions are used to demonstrate three aesthetic flaws that are peculiar to, or particularly relevant for, videogames. This in turn leads to a discussion of the ways that commercially successful games have always proceeded by leveraging the existing networks of practice. The result is an alternative perspective for game design, game scholarship, or game critique, one that foregrounds the role of player practices.},

While `playing with' usually refers to the specific objects used as toys and `playing at' to the roles assumed in such play, examining play situations from the perspective of the make-believe theory of representation (prop theory) suggests a specific relationship between these two aspects of playing. By examining which props are being used in any given play situation, and comparing their metaphorical position in the foreground or background of the imaginary game being played, parallels and distinctions between different kinds of play can be explored and contrasted. The paper offers a phenomenology of imaginative play that helps to clarify exactly what we are playing with when we engage in any kind of imaginings, whether with toys, games, or stories.},

  abstract = {What if the problems of modern society don't come from production, but rather consumption and the system of cultural signs? In this classic work from the defining intellectual of the postmodern, Jean Baudrillard, For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign takes Marx's critique of political economy and its analysis of the commodity form as the starting point for an analysis of signs and their meaning in modern society. Influenced by Lefebvre's critique of everyday life, Barthes's semiology, and Situationism, Baudrillard analyses how objects are encoded within the system of signs and meanings that constitute contemporary media and consumer societies. Combining semiological studies and sociology of the consumer society, For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign contains Baudrillard's most extensive engagement with Marxism and shows him at a critical juncture for the development of his thought.},

  abstract = {Social media data has become crucial to the advancement of scientific understanding. However, even though it has become ubiquitous, just collecting large-scale social media data involves a high degree of engineering skill set and computational resources. In fact, research is often times gated by data engineering problems that must be overcome before analysis can proceed. This has resulted recognition of datasets as meaningful research contributions in and of themselves.Reddit, the so called ``front page of the Internet,'' in particular has been the subject of numerous scientific studies. Although Reddit is relatively open to data acquisition compared to social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, the technical barriers to acquisition still remain. Thus, Reddit's millions of subreddits, hundreds of millions of users, and billions of comments are at the same time relatively accessible, but time consuming to collect and analyze systematically.In this paper, we present the Pushshift Reddit dataset. Pushshift is a social media data collection, analysis, and archiving platform that since 2015 has collected Reddit data and made it available to researchers. Pushshift's Reddit dataset is updated in real-time, and includes historical data back to Reddit's inception. In addition to monthly dumps, Pushshift provides computational tools to aid in searching, aggregating, and performing exploratory analysis on the entirety of the dataset. The Pushshift Reddit dataset makes it possible for social media researchers to reduce time spent in the data collection, cleaning, and storage phases of their projects.},

Among numerous sources of information on mythical creatures, this map and database are unique as they contain geographic references and information on the living environment of so many creatures. Only the most reliable information has been included in the informative and visually attractive wall map. The project included planning, analysis of feasibility, data collection, verification, generalisation and filtering, classification of information on mythical creatures, building the GIS database, analysis of data, and cartographic visualisation. The map described in this paper was finalised in 2012 and designed with special focus on attractiveness for the user. The reference scale of the printed map is 1:7,200,000 and contains an inset of Greece at scale 1:4,000,000. The size of the map image is 62.5\,\texttimes\,83\>cm. It is complemented by textual descriptions of each of 213 creatures. The relational database and exhaustive project documentation are available for further updates and development.},

However, while dystopias are part of the standard gaming repertoire, games feature utopias much less frequently. Why? This anthology examines playful utopias from two perspectives. It investigates utopias in digital games as well as utopias of the digital game; that is, the role of ludic elements in scenarios of the future, as they are, for example, often found in the field of gamification as >>promises of a better world<<.},

Karen Bek-Pedersen provides a thorough understanding of the role played by norns and other beings like them in the relevant sources. Although they are well known, even to people who have only a superficial knowledge of Old Norse mythology, this is the first detailed discussion of the norns to be published amongst the literature dealing with Old Norse beliefs. Surprisingly little has been written specifically about the norns. Although often mentioned in scholarship treating Old Norse culture, the norns are all too often dealt with in overly superficial ways. The research presented in this book goes much deeper in order to properly understand the nature and role of the norns in the Old Norse world view. The conclusions reached by the author overturn a number of stereotypical conceptions that have long dominated our understanding of these beings. The book has a natural focus on Old Norse culture and is especially relevant to those interested in or studying Old Norse culture and tradition. However, comparative material from Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Classical traditions is also employed and the book is therefore of interest also to those with a broader interest in European mythologies.},

We offer a provisional schema which accounts for the variety of ``attractors'' informing these dynamic engagements: simulated, relating to the gameworld; lived, relating to participants' real world experiences and orientations; conventional, relating to participants' prior engagements with other related media; and situated, relating to the localized and embodied settings of play.

  abstract = {The live action role-playing community as a subculture within the United States represents an aspect of repression within the greater society, just as most subcultures in some way do. Due to the unique qualities of the activities in which participants within this subculture engage, indeed because of the very fabric of the subculture itself, it becomes imperative to examine issues of psychological repression and engagement of repressed materials. Within live action role-playing, players both consciously and unconsciously engage in and enact archetypal roles in a liminal and communal setting. Because of the ``safe space'' that is often created during these forms of play---sometimes referred to as the ``magic circle''---participants often find themselves free to explore psychic materials that would be considered part of the shadow. Shadow is a Jungian concept of the repressed, the unknown, or unrecognizable within a consciousness. Just as players may delve into their individual shadows within the frame that archetypal enactment provides them, so too does the subculture as a whole have its own group shadow that can be enacted. In a manner that is somewhat unique to this subculture, group shadow is engaged directly when groups of players play games that evoke shadow issues through their structure. This paper is an examination of shadow within larp. There are many models and methods through which to interpret this concept. However, because of how relevant and heavily related Jungian concepts of archetype and other depth psychological perspectives are to the issue at hand, and because of the sheer lack of previous academic exploration of this topic through this lens, they will be the primary models through which the issue is viewed. In the case of the individual, I will explore the relationship between shadow work in larp and individuation. From there, I will move on to a wider perspective of the group shadow and its engagement. I will investigate the possible consequences of group shadow enactment, as the individuation process is not possible for group consciousnesses. Shadow enactment has the potential for both positive and negative effects on players and the community as a whole. Providing a structure with which to identify, categorize, and understand shadow can contribute to the overall awareness of the psychological processes that occur within and because of larp. This awareness can help players, larpwrights, and organizers to make informed decisions as to how they write, run, and play larps.},

To make the function of this basis for argumentation visible we can use Roland Barthes semiological theory of myths and thereby view argumentation as a mythical rather than logical enterprise. In this article, the concept of myth is discussed in relation to other central concepts in rhetoric, such as doxa, topos and narrative. I illustrate the way myth oriented rhetorical criticism could be performed through an example analysis of the rhetorical strategies of the Moderate party in the Swedish election campaign of 2006.},

As well as highlighting the themes that run throughout his work, the collection demonstrates that his singular style could create extraor-dinary imaginative worlds that will delight those who are fascinated by his thinking, as well as readers of literary fiction such as Franz Kafka and Stefan Zweig and the uncanny tales of E.T.A.

In this article I argue that, despite the fundamental role of agency in CBGs and other sandbox type games, players are constrained by the developers' assumptions and biases regarding how cities ought to look and function. Of particular consideration is the tendency among CBGs to emphasize personal transportation over transit, autocentric over mixed-use development, and simplified social dynamics over a more realistic model.},

  abstract = {Control (Remedy Entertainment) and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice (Ninja Theory) demonstrate the potential for game design that defies expectations of immersive gameplay and embodied avatars. Building on game scholarship that recognizes 'immersion' as a "double-axis of incorporation" [8] consisting of a "complex interplay of actual and virtual worlds as perceived through a dually embodied player" [26,p. 73], we can see how these games achieve powerful moments of coattention through outmersive game design-deliberately alienating the player from an embodied avatar experience. Outmersion,a term coined by Gonzalo Frasca, offers a broader categorization for games that procedurally engender "critical distance" by directing player attention to and outside of the game itself [16]. This article uses close-play to explore how the characters of Jesse Faden in Control and Senua in Hellblade make use of the 'coinhabited avatar' trope-in which the avatar is possessed by non-player entities. This article identifies shared outcomes in the outmersive design of these characters, namely that they: 1) directly invoked the player 2) complicated the player's place in the avatar body 3) deceived the player 4) took agency from the player and 5) referenced game structures directly. Through outmersion, these games created provocative moments of player attention and reflection, simultaneously interrogating assumptions of power, rules, and embodiment. This article advocates for further exploration of outmersive game and interactive narrative design to challenge dominant presumptions about player-avatar interactions.},

Beginning with very primitive games, they quickly evolved into interactive animated works, many of which now approach film in terms of their visual excitement. But there are important differences, as Arthur Asa Berger makes clear in this important new work. Films are purely to be viewed, but video involves the player, moving from empathy to immersion, from being spectators to being actively involved in texts. Berger, a renowned scholar of popular culture, explores the cultural significance of the expanding popularity and sophistication of video games and considers the biological and psychoanalytic aspects of this phenomenon.Berger begins by tracing the evolution of video games from simple games like Pong to new, powerfully involving and complex ones like Myst and Half-Life. He notes how this evolution has built the video industry, which includes the hardware (game-playing consoles) and the software (the games themselves), to revenues comparable to the American film industry.},

In this article, I examine some of the negative interactions that happen within SNGs that may be obscured by the assumption---driven by benevolent sexism---that these games are entirely collaborative. Drawing on posts made to an online forum devoted to YoWorld---a long-running Facebook game---I detail player frustrations with bullying and other forms of interpersonal conflict. I argue that if casual games are only ever seen as docile spaces of collaborative play, it reaffirms the gendered and stereotypical assumptions underpinning who plays SNGs and for what reasons. Furthermore, I argue that assumptions about collaborative and welcoming environments may also be setting novice players up for disappointment when they inevitably encounter anti-social behaviors within a SNG gaming community. If SNGs are framed as an easier entry point for girls and women into broader gaming cultures, it is imperative that alongside encouraging their play, we also equip them with the necessary tools to respond to the negative interactions that they might experience, thereby reducing the likelihood of their eventual disengagement from gaming.},

We argue that nostalgia played an important role for community members, whom we frame as fans. Data came from Reddit communities for The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and the Civilization franchises, comprising data on over 10 million posts from five different year-long time periods, each centered on the release of a new game in each of those franchises.},

The main difference we found was that those who stay in the FO4 subreddit or use both subreddits on average post more often and create longer posts than those who move to the FO76 subreddit or leave. This adds further evidence to support theories about community as communication, and we suggest this finding can help online community managers identify which users may be about to leave the community, aiding retention and the overall health of the community.},

Textual analysis of newspaper items examined coverage about seven female Palestinian suicide bombers. Mythical archetypes changed initially from the male suicide bomber as Trickster, to female bomber as Woman Warrior, and finally, to the Terrible Mother when the circumstances of the seventh suicide bomber no longer fit the Woman Warrior mold. Findings suggest that journalists negotiate their reporting within two realms---realities of occurrences and resonance of myths---to accomplish their work.},

To date, the established tradition of the industry's political--economic analysis focused on the value extraction and user exploitation of video game as a cultural commodity, centered on the video game as generating value through the selling of boxed or digital units. In this article, we present a new analytical framework grounded in understanding the modern video game as an asset that continuously generates revenue for its owners. This theoretical lens encapsulates the changes in contemporary game development, distribution, and value generation. To demonstrate, we apply it to the analysis of the monetization strategies of three recent free-to-play Triple-A titles: Fortnite (2017), Apex Legends (2019), and Call of Duty: Warzone (2020).},

The literature of Critical Theory, on the other hand, is famously opaque, and our Balkanized technical literature on new media storytelling has grown provincial. Daring yet accessible experiments in non-sequential interactive narrative have appeared in unexpected places - in theaters, in experimental novels, and especially in narrativist role-playing games. Narrative automata exhibit considerable sophistication in the frame of simple models of computation. Much of this work is a lot of fun while demonstrating remarkable theoretical depth. In contrast to the cheery hero journeys through depopulated landscapes that long dominated computer games, this work is notably dark, emotionally complex, and introspective.

  abstract = {This research project examines how video games can be programmed to generate the sense of the digital sublime. The digital sublime is a term proposed by this research to describe experiences where the combination of code and art produces games that appear boundless and autonomous. The definition of this term is arrived at by building on various texts and literature such as the work of Kant, Deleuze and Wark and on video games such as Proteus, Minecraft and Love. The research is based on the investigative practice of my work as an artist-programmer and demonstrates how games can be produced to encourage digitally sublime scenarios. In the three games developed for this thesis I employ computer code as an artistic medium, to generate games that explore permutational complexity and present experiences that walk the margins between confusion and control. The structure of this thesis begins with a reading of the Kantian sublime, which I introduce as the foundation for my definition of the digital sublime. I then combine this reading with elements of contemporary philosophy and computational theory to establish a definition applicable to the medium of digital games. This definition is used to guide my art practice in the development of three games that examine different aspects of the digital sublime such as autonomy, abstraction, complexity and permutation. The production of these games is at the core of my research methodology and their development and analysis is used to produce contributions in the following areas. 1. New models for artist-led game design. This includes methods that re-contextualise existing aesthetic forms such as futurism, synaesthesia and romantic landscape through game design and coding. It also presents techniques that merge visuals and mechanics into a format developed for artistic and philosophical enquiry. 2. The development of new procedural and generative techniques in the programming of video games. This includes the implementation of a realtime marching cubes algorithm that generates fractal noise filtered terrain. It also includes a versatile three-dimensional space packing architectural construction algorithm. 3. A new reading of the digital sublime. This reading draws from the Kantian sublime and the writings of Deleuze, Wark and De Landa in order to present an understanding of the digital sublime specific to the domain of art practice within video games. These contributions are evidenced in the writing of this thesis and in the construction of the associated portfolio of games.},

  abstract = {Many users of web search engines have been complaining in recent years about the supposedly decreasing quality of search results. This is often attributed to an increasing amount of search-engine-optimized but low-quality content. Evidence for this has always been anecdotal, yet it's not unreasonable to think that popular online marketing strategies such as affiliate marketing incentivize the mass production of such content to maximize clicks. Since neither this complaint nor affiliate marketing as such have received much attention from the IR community, we hereby lay the groundwork by conducting an in-depth exploratory study of how affiliate content affects today's search engines. We monitored Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo for a year on 7,392 product review queries. Our findings suggest that all search engines have significant problems with highly optimized (affiliate) content---more than is representative for the entire web according to a baseline retrieval system on the ClueWeb22. Focussing on the product review genre, we find that only a small portion of product reviews on the web uses affiliate marketing, but the majority of all search results do. Of all affiliate networks, Amazon Associates is by far the most popular. We further observe an inverse relationship between affiliate marketing use and content complexity, and that all search engines fall victim to large-scale affiliate link spam campaigns. However, we also notice that the line between benign content and spam in the form of content and link farms becomes increasingly blurry---a situation that will surely worsen in the wake of generative AI. We conclude that dynamic adversarial spam in the form of low-quality, mass-produced commercial content deserves more attention.},

We believe that as researchers, students, employees, workers, pupils, retirees, and others---in sum: as citizens---, we must be aware of such discursive moves of othering and exclusion and learn to identify these, connect them to underlying interests, and then resist and subvert them to avoid more killings in our or others' names.

We have tried as best as we could to double-check each single source. Sometimes, names that we have never heard before appeared over and over again, in multiple contributions. Somewhere on this planet, different scholars had come across the same readings. We simply wanted to underline this complex, interwoven net of border-crossing--border-creating literature. As editors from different fields, we have learned of many intriguing discourses that were unknown to us before. Quite often, shared literature lists make visible certain symptoms of academic echo chambers, copy-paste works, or self-referencing networks. Shared foundational texts serve as sense-making tool kits to the members of so-called `fields', and give a hint at somehow negotiated vocabulary within them. Yet, what we have in front of us is an example of an interdisciplinary collaboration of writers. Since our special issue had an `open call', many of our collaborators do not even know each other personally. Yet, in the end, it was possible to build bibliographical bridges between all of them---every single contribution has at least one theoretical link to another article. This way, it is possible to theoretically unite our work, and consider it as (part of) a whole.  A Meta Bibliography of Some Sort---Bridging MaMo's BibliographiesIn short, we consider as a bibliographical bridge the shared bibliographical reference to a particular work or to a particular person by at least two of our issue's authors. If some of our authors refer to `writer A', an imaginary bridge is being created between their contributions---oftentimes unconsciously. These bridges become even more intriguing when noticing that numerous authors independently investigated the identical `work B', without even knowing that another contributor did so as well. Our overview is based on a close examination of all roughly 1000 bibliographical entries in this special issue. It may not be free from errors.

Arguably, this trend is most pervasive in India, where online supporters of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) troll and abuse journalists critical of the Narendra Modi government. Over the years, the BJP has harnessed the digital work of these online Hindu nationalists for agenda setting, spreading their political ideology, and influencing public discourse. Such a symbiotic relationship between the mob and the state has put to question the argument distinguishing mob censorship and state censorship of the press. Through a qualitative textual analysis of tweets posted by online Hindu nationalists, this article explores the discursive strategies employed by right-wing activists to influence the BJP government in its censorship of the press. This study finds that through tactics such as calls to `cancel' journalists, intimidation of foreign correspondents, and digital surveillance of news reporters, online Hindu nationalists aid the BJP government in the suppression of dissident reporting in India.},

Yet, despite the broad range of werewolf depictions found in games, there is a relative paucity of research examining how games depict werewolves and how these depictions relate to the mythos writ large. To address gamic werewolves specifically, this essay performs close readings of several games, notably The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2006) and The Sims 2: Pets (2006). The readings are guided by the works of media scholars, including Alexander Galloway, Ian Bogost, Souvik Mukherjee, Tom Tyler and others. In analysing werewolf avatar gameplay, this essay proposes that some gamic werewolves encourage players to acknowledge and value animal alterity, human animality, and human-animal relations. Additionally, these werewolves foster `becomings' for players, allowing them to understand hybridity and liminality experientially.},

  abstract = {Patricia Piccinini's work has been described as disquieting, compelling and grotesque. Other adjectives often used include disturbing, visceral, monstrous, chimerical but also cute and beautiful. The reason for the encounter of such descriptions which are typically found in separate realms is precisely that Piccinini seeks to fracture unitarian conceptualisations of humanness as she strives to materially debate issues of posthuman ethics. Her concerns relate to issues of breeding, mutation, biotechnology, motherhood/childhood, eco-philosophy and speciesism. In this paper, I will set off from the works of Donna Haraway and Rosi Braidotti to discuss Piccinini's posthuman aesthetics and ethics. I propose to investigate the affirmative posthuman predicament which she has creatively designed for the art gallery space, reflecting the technocultural fabrications of our natureculture continuum. I will focus my attention on three posthuman propositions as they relate to the discourses of motherhood and reproduction: the cyborgian realities of the human and the animal; the organism and the machine; as well as the human, the animal and the vegetable. Piccinini's reconfigurations are created into a world of tenderness and imbued with an ethics of care as she, unlike Victor Frankenstein, aims to love her creatures.},

The suite consists of two games, the first of which (Metro 2033) was based on the self-published novels of Dmitry Glukhovsky: Mempo 2033 (2005) and Mempo 2034 (2009). The games, like the novels, are set in the metro system of Moscow some 20 years after a nuclear apocalypse. Remnant communities, forced underground, congregate in stations that function as nascent city-states. Some stations are independent and unaligned, while others have formed factions (the mercantile ``Hanza,'' the communist ``Red Line,'' and the fascist ``Fourth Reich''). A powerful central coalition, ``Polis,'' through the agency of its ``Spartan'' field agents, seems alone in its attempts to bring order to the metro and recolonize the ruined city above. But Polis and the Spartans are not the only such elements in Metro Redux, and players are quickly immersed in a landscape of Soviet neoclassicism, itself a polyvalent and highly politicized 20th-century Reception. This article will begin to explore what such receptions of Reception might mean. Does the Classical pulse, transmitted across multiple media, degrade to a point of white noise, meaningless and unintelligible? Or can we still find significance in the variation of reflection and transmission?},

  abstract = {Digital games have matured substantially as a narrative medium in the last decade. However, there is still much work to be done to more fully understand the poetics of story-based-games. Game narrative remains an important issue with significant cultural, economic and scholarly implications. In this article, we undertake a critical analysis of the design of narrative within Mass Effect 2: a game whose narrative is highly regarded in both scholarly and vernacular communities. We follow the classic humanities methodology of ``close-reading'': the detailed observation, deconstruction, and analysis of a text. Our close-reading employs a critical framework from our previous work to isolate and highlight the central narrative design parameters within digital games. This framework is grounded in the scholarly discourse around games and narrative, and has been tested and revised in the process of close-reading and analyzing contemporary games. The narrative design parameters we examine are character, storyworld, narrativized interface, emotion, and plot coherence. Our analysis uses these parameters to explicate a series of design decisions for the effective creation of narrative experience in Mass Effect 2, and by extension, for game narratives in general. We also expand our previous methodology through a focused ``edge-case'' strategy for exploring the limits of character, action, and story in the game. Finally, we position our analysis of Mass Effect 2 within contemporary discourses of ``bounded agency'', and explore how the game negotiates the tension between player-expression, and narrative inevitability to create opportunities for sophisticated narrative poetics including tragedy and sacrifice.},

On Stormfront the forum users discuss how their nationalist struggle in the real world resembles that of the fictional Stormcloaks, and how the issues they believe they face in society are mirrored in the struggles in Skyrim. In particular they find the racial and ethnic tensions in the game world parallel to their own ideology of conflict. The article explores the fluidity of traditional schemes of decoding texts, as the players on Stormfront debate the intentions and positions of the game developers, while the open world nature of the game may encourage their preferred, racialized interpretations.},

  abstract = {The Ultima: Age of Enlightenment series is a rich entry into the fantasy genre. In addition to serving as an innovative model for early computer role-playing games (CRPGs), the series practically invents a genre of what can be called ``ethical gaming,'' as it insists on a commitment to virtuous activity in order to complete and master the games. Compared to more linear hack-and-slash or CRPG of the period, the Ultima series not only offers an unusually involved and difficult experience, but also makes explicit and even mandatory ethical and moral dimensions that many saw earlier role-playing games as lacking. However, rather than merely encourage the player to conform to the moral expectations of the game by following procedural rules, the series brings into question the political and spiritual affiliations of virtue. This paper attends to the development of the Age of Enlightenment trilogy---Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar (Origin, 1985), Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny (Origin, 1988), and Ultima VI: The False Prophet (Origin, 1990)---as a series of games that both encourage ethical behavior and later offer a critical examination of the ethical basis that the earliest entry in the trilogy advocates. At the heart of the Age of Enlightenment series is a distinction between absolutist ethics and virtue ethics. In the vein of its most eloquent advocate Immanuel Kant, absolutist theories of ethics begin with principles, duties, and rules that are fundamental and transcendent, and which the moral actor must follow. It is a normative and regulatory system, and exists prior to experience. Virtue ethics challenge the emphasis on duties and rules, instead stressing the importance on motive and character. In this paradigm, ``sensitivity, experience, and judgment would seem to make general theories unnecessary and unhelpful'' (Slote, in: Skorupski (ed) The Routledge companion to ethics, Routledge, London, 2010, p. 479). Or, as Welchman (The practice of virtue: classic and contemporary readings in virtue ethics, Hackett, Indianapolis, 2006) succinctly phrases it, for virtue ethicists, ``the question of how to act is more important than what we should act for'' (p. ix) She adds, in a phrase cannily suggestive for those who have played Ultima, ``moral judgment is not essentially the application of a moral `technical manual' to life'' (p. xvi). In the intriguing narrative developments over the course of the Age of Enlightenment trilogy, that ``moral technical manual'' can be invented and exploited by those who rely on its ability to maintain an unchallenged hierarchy that depends on the principles it contains. And when those rules are applied unilaterally or cross-culturally, they are revealed to be inflexible and even inapplicable, a realization embodied in the narrative and rhetorical transitions I will show occurring between Ultima IV to Ultima VI. More than just a highminded game, I argue that Ultima makes an argument about virtue through what Bogost (Persuasive games: the expressive power of videogames, MIT Press, Cambridge, 2010) calls its procedural rhetoric. To play the Age of Enlightenment series is to grapple with the question of whether morality has relative or transcendent foundations, and the game introduces compelling arguments only to later challenge them.},

First, why is the experience of playing these games not innately inferior to that of playing games with a first-person point of view, given that the sense of being a character sensing and acting inside the game space could be expected to be much stronger when the character's body seems to be one's own rather than a separate entity in the game space? And second, if the first-person point of view is so ``immersive'' and provides such a sense of being ``inside'' the representational space as is sometimes claimed, why has it never been so prominent in other audiovisual entertainment media such as film and television?},

Four questions were posed: (1) Is there a general tendency for evaluations of candidates to improve or deteriorate after a debate? (2) Do evaluations of one candidate negatively correlate with changes in evaluations of opponents? (3) Do debates disadvantage incumbents? (4) Do debates advantage less popular candidates? Using ``feeling thermometer'' items to measure voter evaluations, four patterns are revealed. First, candidates generally gain points.The supposed mudslinging that characterizes a debate appears not to feed into any notion of cynicism. Instead, voters appear to gain an appreciation for the debaters. Second, a candidate's gain is not earned at the expense of those deemed to have ``lost'' the match. Third, a debate does not disadvantage an incumbent. A candidate with a record to defend stands about as much chance of benefiting from a debate as a challenger.And fourth, any evaluation gaps before a debate become narrower following a debate. This final effect, which is particularly true of American presidential debates, may reflect a debate's ability to raise awareness of less popular candidates.},

You'll discover how popular pseudoscience has radically changed the world we live in-in spheres as different as dating, economics, politics, and artificial intelligence. The abuse of popular scientific authority has had catastrophic consequences, contributing to the 2008 financial crisis; the failure to predict the rise of Donald Trump; increased tensions between poor communities and the police; and the side lining of non-scientific forms of knowledge and wisdom. But you also will learn a way out of the superstition and ideology of scientism. This book introduces readers to a movement called the "hermeneutic" or interpretive approach that promises to free ordinary people from the tyranny of pseudoscience. An interpretive approach to human life offers a way to become a better reader of both the many claims to science around you as well as the cultural spaces you inhabit and help create"--},

Specifically, this text is concerned with the way these games play out the conflict between traditional cultural values and posthumanity in a postmodern context; the narrative elements of Japanese RPGs seem to be deployed in an effort to problematize any relationship between the posthuman and the heroic, and the gameworlds reflect this demonization and Othering of posthumanity. Specific texts will be examined in the context of the traditional narrative elements which they employ, including various Japanese myths, legends, and narratives, in hopes of exploring not only the loaded comparison these games make between traditional Japanese heroism and posthumanism but also between Japanese and American notions of the heroic. Finally, this text will attempt to combine the theories of ludology, narratology, and folklore for the study of digital games, an approach uncommon in this highly factious discipline.},

  abstract = {This study presents a theory about dynamic game characters within a broader character ecology in which characters are constantly produced and reproduced in a variety of media. Characters do not appear only in games, they migrate from one medium to another. They are independent from any medium in particular: a character does not require a specific medium to come into existence. Authoritative forces try to shape the overall interpretation of circulating characters transmedially in comics, television series, films, games and more through different venues of control, such as authorship, canonisation and ownership or intellectual property. This study addresses the struggle for interpretive authority by explaining how the player constructs the identity of dynamic game characters in digital games, and by discussing how dynamic game characters connect to and influence other character manifestations within a broader media ecology in which characters circulate. The research question of this study is: What are dynamic game characters? Through reader-response theory adapted for cybermedia phenomena such as games, this study approaches characters as a player-constructed phenomenon, in which the game character needs the player in order to be invoked, but the game encourages the meaning-making process with different means to different effects. Dynamic game characters are those game characters whose development structures branch into different outcomes, each of which are undetermined until the player actualises one or more possibilities that steer that direction onto distinct paths with a specific outcome. Dynamic game characters have become a phenomenon that challenges practices of (trans-)media control. A theory of dynamic game characters tells us about the migration of entities via different works, and how the perceiver comes to understand them within a context saturated with characters, stories and a variety of media platforms. Digital games are just one of the many media platforms that participate in this character ecology, and they allow characters to challenge the idea that within a single piece of work the character must maintain a linear, continuous and coherent identity that stretches the understanding of characters as authored and predictable within a single work. This study argues that dynamic game characters are a type of quasi-person in digital games whose development consists of multiple outcomes. Digital games accelerate a dynamic game character's identity within a single work, unlike non-cybermedia in which a character's identity is constructed over multiple works. They challenge venues of control, because the player has creative agency over the dynamic game character's characterisation process within a single work. However, once dynamic game characters transfer to other works, authoritative institutions break the player's participation in the dynamic game character's development. These transfers sacrifice player participation to create the illusion of a coherent identity between the manifestations of the character over multiple works.},

Through a case study of the Overwatch franchise (Blizzard Entertainment 2016 -- 2018), this paper challenges the notion of transmedial worlds central to the idea of transmedia storytelling. Based on Anderson's notion of Imagined Communities (1983), it proposes instead to consider transmedial universes that include games such as Overwatch as shared universes that take into consideration various types of worlds, such as virtual worlds, by focusing on how the Overwatch franchise supports the connection between consumers.},

Kerrigan's subjectivity as a player-character complicates her in ways that require a different application of the monstrous-feminine from those characters from literature, film, and video games that position them as enemies to overcome. The article begins examining Kerrigan through the lens of the monstrous-feminine and the abject before discussing how her hypersexualization ostensibly contradicts her monstrosity as an empowering force. The author then explores the obstacles Kerrigan must overcome and how this struggle reifies her disruption of and resistance against the symbolic order. The discussion concludes that Kerrigan's connection between the player and monstrous-feminine character is a significant paradigm shift for the female monster and how agency and empathy allow players to understand the monstrous-feminine in a new perspective.},

  abstract = {Rich connections between gaming and theater stretch back to the 16th and 17th centuries, when England's first commercial theaters appeared right next door to gaming houses and blood-sport arenas. In the first book-length exploration of gaming in the early modern period, Gina Bloom shows that theaters succeeded in London's new entertainment marketplace largely because watching a play and playing a game were similar experiences. Audiences did not just see a play; they were encouraged to play the play, and knowledge of gaming helped them become better theatergoers. Examining dramas written for these theaters alongside evidence of analog games popular then and today, Bloom argues for games as theatrical media and theater as an interactive gaming technology. Gaming the Stage also introduces a new archive for game studies: scenes of onstage gaming, which appear at climactic moments in dramatic literature. Bloom reveals plays to be systems of information for theater spectators: games of withholding, divulging, speculating, and wagering on knowledge. Her book breaks new ground through examinations of plays such as The Tempest, Arden of Faversham, A Woman Killed with Kindness, and A Game at Chess; the histories of familiar games such as cards, backgammon, and chess; less familiar ones, like Game of the Goose; and even a mixed-reality theater videogame.},

Now the primary technical challenge is simply getting the code to work to produce an end result that bears some semblance to the desired functionality. To the extent that we optimize, we are usually concerned with high-level algorithmic choices. There's such a wide variety of algorithms to know about, so much experience required to implement them in a useful way, and so much work overall that just needs to be done, that we have a perpetual shortage of qualified people in the industry.},

Aerospace-themed survival-crafting game Astroneer (2019) by System Era Softworks is one of many such video games released since that capitalizes on this trend. The appeal of such games lies in that they can be enjoyed by players with various interests, abilities and backgrounds: the average player can mine, build, and fight whatever and whomever they please, or even create entire games within the game. The design of such games is, in many ways, less constricted than that of other avatar-based genres, such as action-adventures or first-person shooters. Freedom, playfulness, and creative play are often associated with such design, which evoke questions about agency. This article connects these notions and asks: can agency help us better understand how playfulness can be designed? By interrogating the paratexts surrounding the game's development to see how developers discussed design decisions that facilitate playfulness, this article illustrates how thinking of agency as something afforded by game design can be a productive analytical tool to identify design decisions that facilitate player freedom and creative thinking. This, in turn, sheds light on whether, and if so how, playfulness can be designed.},

I draw on sociologist Anthony Giddens' notion of ``ontological security'' -- which refers to our sense of stability and safety that we draw from continuous, and therefore reliable, predictable, unthreatening, and familiar sequences of events or activities happening in our everyday lives -- and propose the concept of ``cozy agency'' to productively examine the aesthetics of games that are not characterized by a hypermasculine drive to successfully overcome challenges, nor by the inessentiality of player action typical of idle games. Research on lifestyle media, cuteness, and vegetal affect is put into dialogue to theorize the modalities of agency typical cozy game aesthetics can afford and constrain. Such an approach is in line with recent shifts in discourses of agency and interactivity in game studies, which criticize these two terms for being too binary, masculine, and not accommodating alternative forms of engagement with games, with recent scholarship on agency especially calling for a politicization of the term and a call to delve into the significance of meaningful empowerment to act in/with/on/through games.},

The recent advent of environmental philosophy and posthuman studies has widened our scope of inquiry to include ecosystems, animals, and artificial intelligence. Yet the vast majority of the stuff in our universe, and even in our lives, remains beyond serious philosophical concern. In Alien Phenomenology, or What It's Like to Be a Thing, Ian Bogost develops an object-oriented ontology that puts things at the center of being---a philosophy in which nothing exists any more or less than anything else, in which humans are elements but not the sole or even primary elements of philosophical interest. And unlike experimental phenomenology or the philosophy of technology, Bogost's alien phenomenology takes for granted that all beings interact with and perceive one another. This experience, however, withdraws from human comprehension and becomes accessible only through a speculative philosophy based on metaphor. Providing a new approach for understanding the experience of things as things, Bogost also calls on philosophers to rethink their craft. Drawing on his own background as a videogame designer, Bogost encourages professional thinkers to become makers as well, engineers who construct things as much as they think and write about them.},

However, commercial video games received minor attention. In this article, we describe how video game play impacted the life transformations engendered by the pandemic. We administered a qualitative online survey to 330 video game players who were living in Italy during the lockdown measures. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic altered the participants' sense of time and space, reshaped both their intimate and wider social interactions, and elicited a wide spectrum of disturbing emotions. Players escaped from this unsatisfying reality into video game worlds, searching for a new normality that could compensate for the unpredictability and dangerousness of the pandemic life, as well as seeking uncertainty in the game environments to balance the flatness of the lockdown everydayness. In doing so, they ``appropriated'' the gaming technologies, which also led to several unexpected outcomes. Starting from these findings, we propose a model of escapism that points out four ways to escape from reality into video game worlds. Moreover, we outline some design implications that might inspire future strands of research in the field of crisis technologies.},

Elegantly defined as "games about games," metagames implicate a diverse range of practices that stray outside the boundaries and bend the rules: from technical glitches and forbidden strategies to Renaissance painting, algorithmic trading, professional sports, and the War on Terror. In Metagaming, Stephanie Boluk and Patrick LeMieux demonstrate how games always extend beyond the screen, and how modders, mappers, streamers, spectators, analysts, and artists are changing the way we play. Metagaming uncovers these alternative histories of play by exploring the strange experiences and unexpected effects that emerge in, on, around, and through videogames. Players puzzle through the problems of perspectival rendering in Portal, perform clandestine acts of electronic espionage in EVE Online, compete and commentate in Korean StarCraft, and speedrun The Legend of Zelda in record times (with or without the use of vision). Companies like Valve attempt to capture the metagame through international e-sports and online marketplaces while the corporate history of Super Mario Bros. is undermined by the endless levels of Infinite Mario, the frustrating pranks of Asshole Mario, and even Super Mario Clouds, a ROM hack exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art. One of the only books to include original software alongside each chapter, Metagaming transforms videogames from packaged products into instruments, equipment, tools, and toys for intervening in the sensory and political economies of everyday life. And although videogames conflate the creativity, criticality, and craft of play with the act of consumption, we don't simply play videogames--we make metagames"--},

  abstract = {This paper pursues the exploration of city-spaces in single-player fantasy roleplaying games in terms of their nostalgically pseudo-historical representation, focusing upon the significance of three recurring landmarks: the marketplace, the square and the tavern. The games chosen for close analysis in this paper are Baldur's Gate (BioWare 1998), Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn (BioWare 2000), Dragon Age: Origins (Bioware 2009), The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (Bethesda 2008), The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Bethesda 2011) and The Witcher III: The Wild Hunt (CD Projekt 2015). This exploration is founded upon the recognition that these are games produced and consumed within a neoliberal context (M\"oring and Leino 2016), that has its own specificity -- yet, this is a specificity that also aspires to be totalising and dehistoricising. Within this context, these games -- and their representation of urban space -- will be examined as works of ``fantastic neomedievalism,'' which, as Eco suggests, represents both a nostalgia for an imagined past and a critical potential resulting from the recognition that ``all the problems of the Western world emerged in the Middle Ages'' (1986, 64). On that basis, this paper shall make the claim that there are at least three interrelated paths along which we can read the significance of these game's neomedievalist urban spaces. The first is the nostalgic element (Hutcheon 2000; Boym 2001) -- manifested, for example, in the evocation of a world structured on a binary rural-urban divide that is lost in the contemporary urban metropolis (Lefebvre 2003, 11), and resulting in the games' rural spaces becoming sites for nostalgia of the pastoral variety (Martin 2011). The second is their critical capacity to act as interrogations of power structures such as legal, political, religious and financial authority. To qualify this critical potential, however, the third point is that containment of these power structures within a fantastical neomedievalist domain may result not in a critique of the contemporary moment but in a complacent comfort in our distance from, and superiority to, the medieval domains in question -- while still allowing us to enjoy our visit as a `tourist' in that world. The marketplace, in the games considered here, fulfils a double function -- it is a nexus that connects the avatar with the familiar currency exchange that characterises capitalism, and suggests an interchange that includes the player as consumer within an intersecting network. On the other hand, it is also representative of a more Bakhtinian vision (1984) of a democratising vibrancy associated with the marketplace as a centre for collective participation in the social life of the town/city, as opposed to the univocal homogeneity of the late capitalist supermarket (Alexander et al 1977, 247) Indeed, the marketplace is sometimes not clearly spatially differentiated from the square, though different functions may be associated with the latter. The square, while it holds forth the promise of a communal space (Harvey 2013, xvii), is frequently simultaneously the site where law asserts itself, and displays its power -- through, for example, a scaffold or other platform for public punishment, suggesting a more brutal exercise of authority -- as is the case, for example, when, upon Geralt's arrival in Novigrad in The Witcher III, he is led to Hierarch Square, where he witnesses the public burnings of magic-users by the city's religious authorities. The third urban site discussed, the tavern is another space where the competing powers of hierarchised traditional sometimes-oppressive authority (political and religious authorities, and the law) and the market meet in joint conviviality or the occasional brawl. All together, the market, the square and the tavern are spaces of interaction, evincing more similarity than difference across games, manifesting a genericity that plays to expectations. However, they also testify to a space for contestation and negotiation of power, within which the player is granted a degree of agency to participate. For example, the player-avatar in Skyrim can take advantage of the fact that her `autonomous' agency is not hijacked by a cutscene, and mount some resistance by interfering in the execution that greets her entry into Solitude (even though the fact that the game doesn't sustain the consequences of this intervention highlights the rigidity of the game's own power structures, and the limits they place upon the player).},

Interestingly, the first example concerns the widespread Internet memes phenomenon. But is Mozilla's statement correct? This article aims to answer this question with respect to the EU law framework. US literature has already thoroughly engaged with this topic,2 but academics have only partially tackled Internet memes in Europe. Copyright infringement issues have been highlighted by literature for the purposes of focussing on the inadequacy of EU copyright legislation in respect of current technological advancements,3 but a sound analysis of what the phenomenon is in order to understand the basis of copyright law concerns---particularly from the point of view of meme-generating platforms---is still missing. Such approach is important since it shows that for every single Internet user practice,4 whether hyperlinking or making memes, a targeted analysis is pivotal to reach the right conclusion.},

This paper defines the distinct staging of untamed and pristine environment in open world games as striated wilderness which is constituted by aesthetics and gazing regimes of Western culture as well as by modularity and variability of computer games as data bases. Merging the wilderness discourse with concepts of tourist gaze and prospect-refuge theory, rural open world games can be analyzed as rhythmized liminal spaces of the man-nature dichotomy. Thus, they stand in the tradition of landscape gardens and nature parks where former survival instincts and urges for exploration are experienced for recreation and entertainment. Striated wilderness has to be differentiated between place (wilderness) and practice (wildness). How do open world games regulate our understanding of landscape and longing for nature?},

The article traces the long history of misinformation and conspiracy in American politics and demonstrates how the introduction of entertainment industry design methodologies has altered the production of disinformation campaigns. From Andrew Jackson and the New York Slave Conspiracy of 1741 through Gamergate and QAnon, the article argues that while conspiracy has always been a central part of American culture, the introduction of modern game design has altered the landscape, and that only by recognizing how our work as designers is being co-opted can we can begin to work to prevent additional social harms.},

In the offending scene, which occurs early in the game, the game forces the protagonist, Booker DeWitt, to undergo a Christian baptismal ritual. The ritual is mandatory for the player in order to proceed with the game. Malmberg characterized the choice as extreme blasphemy . When the player decides to undergo the ritual, he is (almost) drowned in the process. That at least four of these baptismal rituals, all with lethal consequences, occur in Bioshock Infinite, a game whose narrative context is critical of the religiously inspired exceptionalism of the United States of America, is highly interesting. Developer Irrational Games has succeeded not only in incorporating religious beliefs, rituals and criticisms in a highly-complex narrative, but also in inviting (or even: forcing) the player to participate in ritual behavior itself.},

Video games have become one of the most important cultural artifacts of modern society, both as mediators of cultural, social, and religious values and in terms of commercial success. This has led to a significant increase in the critical analysis of this relatively new medium, but theology as an academic discipline is noticeably behind the other humanities on this subject. The book first covers the fundamentals of cultural theology and video games. It then moves on to set out a Christian systematic theology of gaming, focusing on creational theology, Christology, anthropology, evil, moral theology, and thanatology. Each chapter introduces case studies from video games connected to the specific theme. In contrast to many studies which focus on online multiplayer games, the examples considered are largely single player games with distinct narratives and 'end of game' moments. The book concludes by synthesizing these themes into a new theology of video games. This study addresses a significant aspect of contemporary society that has yet to be discussed in any depth by theologians. It is, therefore, a fantastic resource for any scholar engaging with the religious aspects of digital and popular culture.},

In three video games, the Diablo series (three games, between 1996-2012), the Darksiders series (two games, in 2010 and 212) and the Devil May Cry series (2001-2013, especially in the so called `reboot' of 2013), Lilith and the Nephilim are both named and (in different ways) connected to each other within the greater narrative of the games. In this article I want to describe the three game narratives in which the Nephilim and Lilith have their place, and in what way those three narratives are connected to each other.  The central question of this article is: what have the narratives of Diablo, Darksiders and DmC in common regarding the Nephilim and Lilith, and what theological implications follow from this common ground? I will argue that the combination of Lilith and Nephilim in these three game narratives is key for creating a mix of ontological and cosmological dualism in relation to a more complex anthropological `holism'. The three narratives provide a more or less psychologically convenient explanation for the existence of evil in the world, and at the same time take into account the experience that the human beings we encounter in our everyday life appear to us as incorporating both good and bad deeds, intentions, inclinations, traits and thoughts.},

Both factions compete over the possession of mythical artefacts, called the `Apples of Eden', which once belonged to a now extinct proto-human race. The possession of these artefacts gives the owner incredible knowledge and the ability to manipulate large numbers of people. The Templars strive for world domination, while the Assassins want to prevent this; their aim is to develop human consciousness and individual freedom. Considering games as `playable texts', I make an inventory of three in-game rituals, two of the Assassin Brotherhood and one of the Templar Order. Both initiation and assassination rituals are quite elaborate given the context of the games in which they are displayed. Progression and regression can be observed in terms of ritual practices within the primary series of the game series, which stretches from ancient Egypt to modernity. This article describes the three ritual practices mentioned within the Assassin's Creed series, and links them to the larger metanarrative of the series.},

Our study aims to answer the following questions: (1) Can we measure a successful and popular game's experience with GEQ? (2) What are the gameplay elements that make this game so popular? (3) Are there any correlations with the subscales of GEQ and the gameplay elements in question?},

From reading games as technical and cultural artifacts to exploring players, player communities, and the industry itself. Toxic culture within gaming communities and the gaming industry has negatively affected and even harmed individuals, community growth, the creative potential of video games, and even the study of some topics in game studies. This is not up for debate. However, toxic culture plays a role in shaping alternative visions and methods of inclusivity, as those affected by it push against the toxic boundaries and existing conditions through a wide range of strategies to create positive change. From supportive threads on social media to coordinated, collective efforts in the form of the creation of organizations, events, and emotional support networks, this article looks at resistance to toxic gaming culture and how it reshapes and reconstructs the boundaries and social norms towards creating a more inclusive gaming community and culture.

  abstract = {This dissertation examines the complex nature of identity in single-player videogames. It introduces the concept of hybrid-identity and proposes an analytical framework to deconstruct gameplay across genres to distinguish moments of identity emergence. While identity research commonly focuses on the player or the player-character (or both), the concept of hybrid-identity is a fluid, at times fleeting form of identity that exists between the player and the player-character. Hybrid-identity develops during the networked process of videogame play and necessarily includes the player (experience, play-context, etc.), the game environment (design, mechanics, etc.), and the mediating technology (computer, console, etc.) that facilitates gameplay. In order to delineate the different aspects of gameplay that contribute to the emergence of different types of identity, a multifaceted framework was devised to isolate specific interactions between the player/player-character, player-character/non-playing character, player/game environment, player-character/game environment, and player/player. This framework was coupled with a secondary frame which includes examining the specificities of the individual player and the mediating technologies that facilitate gameplay. A systematic analysis of gameplay and design elements of three different games; Mirror's Edge (DICE, 2008), Alone in the Dark (Eden Games, 2008), and Fable 2 (Lionhead Studios, 2008) was performed to illustrate the varying degrees of identity emergence in different game structures. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by comparing the three gameplay analyses and highlighting the elements that contribute to (and possibly hinder) identity development and more specifically, the emergence of hybrid-identity. These three examples form the foundation for a more in-depth discussion on the definition, context, and process of hybrid-identity in videogame play.},

  abstract = {"From mobile phones to consoles, tablets and PCs, we are now a generation of gamers. The PlayStation Dreamworld is--to borrow a phrase from Slavoj Zizek--the pervert's guide to videogames. It argues that we can only understand the world of videogames via Lacanian dream analysis. It also argues that the Left needs to work inside this dreamspace \&ndash; a powerful arena for constructing our desires \&ndash; or else the dreamworld will fall entirely into the hands of dominant and reactionary forces. While cyberspace is increasingly dominated by corporate organization, gaming, at its most subversive, can nevertheless produce radical forms of enjoyment which threaten the capitalist norms that are created and endlessly repeated in our daily relationships with mobile phones, videogames, computers and other forms of technological entertainment. Far from being a book solely for dedicated gamers, this book dissects the structure of our relationships to all technological entertainment at a time when entertainment has become ubiquitous. We can no longer escape our fantasies but rather live inside their digital reality"--},

The findings suggest that moral foundation predicts what type of moral decisions a player will make during play. This research reports an online survey (N=138) that asked participants the salience of their moral foundations, along with the moral path, either traditionally heroic (paragon) or traditionally antiheroic (renegade), they chose in their first time playing through the Mass Effect series. The results indicate that moral foundations predict the extent to which game path players choose, but only with regard to the harm/care moral foundation. These findings are discussed in light of game design and the potential for game designers to use morality as a game mechanic beyond the harm foundation and into realms of more nuanced moral situations in game narratives.},

Utilizing frameworks and methodologies from musicology, ethnomusicology, film studies, and sound studies, the analyses presented in this thesis provide a better understanding of how music and sound impact a player's perception of a virtual environment. The first chapter analyzes compositional works by Koji Kondo, focusing on musical themes and motifs from earlier Legend of Zelda games. As subsequent Legend of Zelda games utilize these themes and motifs, it is necessary to provide a historical analysis. The second chapter discusses the application of concepts from film studies to video games, first by providing a comparison of the development of sound technology in both industries. Case studies from Ocarina of Time (Nintendo 1998) and Breath of the Wild conclude the chapter. The third and fourth chapters analyze the relationships between sonic environments and players' gameplay experiences. The first of these two chapters examine ``stationary sonic environments,'' defined as sonic spaces that remain in place and relatively unchanged by a player's movement. The second analyzes ``moving sonic environments,'' defined as sonic spaces that change and develop as the player moves through them. The conclusion of this thesis offers ideas for additional areas of research as well as emphasizes the importance of scholarship on video game music.},

This term refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to revive and repurpose the performances and personas of individuals from the past. Far from being confined to the entertainment sector, the ripple effects of Digital Lazarus challenge our understanding of authenticity, talent, and the human experience itself. The review article explores the ethical dilemmas of resurrecting popular figures, the unsettling eeriness of increasingly human-like AI entities, and the commercial motivations that drive such initiatives. It also examines the profound impact on societal communication, the life cycle of talent, and the altered grief process in the digital age. By raising critical questions about the exploitation or honoring of legacies, the article offers a nuanced perspective on a future where the boundaries between the real and the artificial are not just blurred but are being actively redefined.},

  abstract = {Video games are works of written code that portray worlds and characters in action and facilitate an aesthetic and interpretive experience. Beyond this similarity to literary works, some video games deploy various design strategies that blend gameplay and literary elements to explicitly foreground a hybrid literary/ludic experience. We identify three such strategies: engaging with literary structures, forms, and techniques; deploying text in an aesthetic rather than a functional way; and intertextuality. This article aims to analyze how these design strategies are deployed in What Remains of Edith Finch to support a hybrid readerly/playerly experience. We argue that this type of design is particularly suited for walking simulators (or walking sims) because they support interpretive play through slowness, ambiguity, narrative, and aesthetic aspirations. Understanding walking sims as literary games can shift the emphasis from their lack of ``traditional'' gameplay complexity and focus instead on the opportunities that they afford for hybrid storytelling and for weaving literature and gameplay in innovative and playful ways.},

This study reflects the outcomes of REVEAL, a three-year European Union research project investigating the use and impact of services for fact-checking and verification. Based on interviews with 32 young journalists and content analysis of social media users' online conversations, we contribute new knowledge about the ways that journalists and social media users perceive online fact-checking and verification services. The findings suggest that, while young journalists were largely unfamiliar with or ambivalent about such services, they judged them as potentially useful in the investigative journalistic process. Yet, they were unwilling to rely exclusively on these tools for fact-checking and verification. A comparison of journalists' perceptions with those of social media users reveals social media users are similarly ambivalent. Some accentuated the usefulness of such services, while others expressed strong distrust. However, the journalists displayed a more nuanced perspective, both seeing these services as potentially useful and being reluctant to blindly trust a single service. Design strategies to make online fact-checking and verification services more useful and trustworthy are suggested.},

The results highlight design pitfalls and innovations regarding accessibility in four key areas: auditory, visual, motor, and difficulty. As a feed-forward project, the aim is not simply to catalog what games include which accessibility features, a nearly impossible feat considering how varied the design features are, depending on the game.

Grounded Theory is used to construct a robust division of immersion into the three levels: engagement, engrossment and total immersion. This division alone suggests new lines for investigating immersion and transferring it into software domains other than games.},

  abstract = {Computer games are now a significant consumption activity in consumer culture. Informed by interdisciplinary studies and drawing on data from in-depth interviews with players of the Warcraft III computer game, we explore the relationship between play and storytelling during digital play. Understanding that such play is determined by systems of game rules and that computer game characters and settings are capable of conveying cultural meanings to players, we found that the rules of play in computer games can be designed in ways that encourage consumers to co-create meaningful story plots derived from their knowledge of myth and fiction. In the case of Warcraft, these plots resembled the archetypal plot of the hero's journey. We conclude that computer games immerse consumers in a form of playful consumption that engages them in memorialised, co-authored storytelling.},

The argument is made that despite the usefulness in pointing out some of the epistemological challenges relating to algorithms, the figure of the black box constitutes somewhat of a distraction from other, perhaps more pressing, questions and issues. Moving beyond the notion that algorithms are black boxes, the chapter synthesizes and extends existing approaches and makes a case for using well-known methods to new domains, not only generating knowledge about emerging issues and practices, but contributing to (re)inventing methods.},

A separate, parallel body of work has explored existential risks to humanity, including but not limited to that stemming from unaligned Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). In this paper, we problematise the notion that current and near-term artificial intelligence technologies have the potential to contribute to existential risk by acting as intermediate risk factors, and that this potential is not limited to the unaligned AGI scenario. We propose the hypothesis that certain already-documented effects of AI can act as existential risk factors, magnifying the likelihood of previously identified sources of existential risk. Moreover, future developments in the coming decade hold the potential to significantly exacerbate these risk factors, even in the absence of artificial general intelligence. Our main contribution is a (non-exhaustive) exposition of potential AI risk factors and the causal relationships between them, focusing on how AI can affect power dynamics and information security. This exposition demonstrates that there exist causal pathways from AI systems to existential risks that do not presuppose hypothetical future AI capabilities.},

Rather than writing a singular defence of the humanities against economic rationalism, Zoe Hope Bulaitis constructs a nuanced map of the intersections of value in the humanities, encompassing an exploration of policy engagement, scientific discourses, fictional representation, and the humanities in public life. The book articulates a kaleidoscopic range of humanities practices which demonstrate that although recent policy encourages higher education to be entirely motivated by outcomes, fiscal targets, and the acquisition of employability skills, the humanities continue to inspire and aspire beyond these limits. This book is a historically-grounded and theoretically-informed analysis of the value of the humanities within the context of the market.},

Therefore, this research explored players of Assassin's Creed games' understanding of these two concepts and how they expected developers to utilize them. The study used a qualitative analysis of 959 online forum comments and an online survey with 88 respondents. While it was found that players understood historical accuracy and valued it in video games, historical authenticity prompted confusion with 43\% describing it as the same as historical accuracy. The results were used to develop a new player-centric definition of historical authenticity to clarify player understandings and present useful and practical implications for developers and publishers.},

Players demonstrated emotional attachment for the characters and narrative and expected to see the consequences of their choices play out, as in the previous games. Furthermore, players conflated winning the game with achieving a narratively satisfactory ending for the game world and its characters indicating emotional consequences for players that developers should consider when designing games with a high degree of player choice and agency. However, for some players character attachment is incongruous as they described Shepard as ``acting out of character,'' which needs further research.},

It argues that the avatar is a two-part structure, partly designed in conventional narrative terms as a protagonist of popular narrative, and partly as a vehicle for interactive game-play. The former structure is replete with the traditions and designs of Japanese popular narrative, oral formulaic narrative and contemporary superhero narratives, and is presented to the player as an offer act -- a declarative narrative statement. The latter is a construct of evolving attributes and economies characteristic of role-playing games; and is presented to the player as a demand act -- a rule-based command. Though these two functions separate out in the grammar of player and fan discourse, it is their integration which provides the pleasure of gameplay and narrative engagement.},

The architectural design that intertwines Facebook and FarmVille is heightened by the formal and informal participation in ritual practices, which we theorize as digital rituals. Facebook and FarmVille provide a substantive case study that delves into the topical blurring of lines around the game space or magic circle. Through digital ethnographic methodologies the article identifies a number of digital ritual engagements that fit well with Grant McCracken's (1986) four different kinds of consumer rituals: exchange rituals, possession rituals, grooming rituals, and divestment rituals. Social gaming is contextualized as the extension of digital third places complicating distinctions between social network and social networking sites. Beyond simply phatic communication or decompression, FarmVille and Facebook through digital ritual participation are increasingly the manifestation of our networked interests, communities, and lives.},

  abstract = {Joseph Campbell's Monomyth not only provides a well-proven pattern for successful storytelling, it may also help to guide teams and team leaders through the challenges of change and innovation processes. In project "HELD: Innovationsdramaturgie nach dem Heldenprinzip" researchers of the University of the Arts Berlin and the Berlin Gameslab, part of the University of Applied Sciences HTW-Berlin, team up to examine the applicability of the Hero's Journey to change management using an adaptation of Campbell's pattern called ,,Heldenprinzip\textregistered ``. The project's goal is not to teach the stages of the Monomyth as mere facts but to enable participants of training courses and interventions to actually experience its concepts using a portfolio of creative and aesthetic methods. While a pool of aesthetic methods - like drawing, performing or role-playing - is already being used, the Gameslab subproject qualitatively researches the potentials for enriching and complementing these methods with interactive digital media and games. This paper discusses three types of game based learning treatments to be used in training and intervention sessions as well as teaching the Monomyth in a game based learning university course. The first option is providing participants with a game that follows the Hero's Journey and inducing them to reflect on the experience and its relation to the learning goal. An alternative strategy is to make participants go through a game sequence broaching issues that are relevant for a stage or the journey of change in general. Last but not least, digital equivalents of the non-digital aesthetic methods can be constructed using digital games or digitally enhanced set-ups for playful interactions. All three treatments have their merits and pitfalls, which are discussed in relation to the identified game-based learning scenarios: self-study, blended game-based learning and face-to-face sessions. Furthermore, these scenarios are compared while specific techniques boundary conditions are highlighted.},

One should not systematically exclude unpublished studies from meta-analytic reviews. There is no evidence of publication or selection bias in our data. We did not purposely exclude certain studies; we included all studies that met our inclusion criteria. Although C. J. Ferguson and J. Kilburn believe that the effects we obtained are trivial in size, they are larger than many effects that are deemed sufficiently large to warrant action in medical and violence domains. The claim that we (and other media violence scholars) are attempting to create a false crisis is a red herring.},

  abstract = {In this commentary, we first analyze Elson and Ferguson's (2013) attempt to offer a theory that would explain why exposure to family, community, school, and media violence could be related to increased aggression, but not cause such aggression. We conclude that the ``new'' theory they offer is not very ``new.'' It differs from dominant social learning theories only in its claim that the relation between exposure to violence and aggression is almost entirely due to people who are genetically or biologically predisposed to be aggressive also exposing themselves to more violence. We show this assertion is strongly contradicted by existing experimental and longitudinal data. We also show that Elson and Ferguson's so-called ``exhaustive review'' of empirical data on the topic is seriously flawed; that their claim that effect sizes are trivial is not supported by the math; and that their claim that scholars who believe that violent video games cause aggression are an ``extreme'' group in a divided field is contradicted by surveys that show the vast majority of researchers believe violent video games increase aggression. We point out that their claim that scholars who believe in media violence effects are having a ``moral panic'' has no theoretical or empirical support, whereas the contrasting argument that researchers who produce violent media themselves, or use it extensively, are biased by the force of cognitive consistency and experience a ``reactance'' of ``regulatory panic'' does have support from psychological theory.},

It maps out the key debates, and includes chapters on the historical origins of conspiracy theories, as well as their political significance in a broad range of countries and regions. Other chapters consider the psychology and the sociology of conspiracy beliefs, in addition to their changing cultural forms, functions and modes of transmission. This handbook examines where conspiracy theories come from, who believes in them, and what their consequences are. This book presents an important resource for students and scholars from a range of disciplines interested in the societal and political impact of conspiracy theories, including Area Studies, Anthropology, History, Media and Cultural Studies, Political Science, Psychology and Sociology"--},

  abstract = {This thesis examines gaming lifeworlds and seeks interventions into the hegemony of gaming culture tied to a persistent imaginary of `Gamers' as young white heterosexual males. Despite attempts to cultivate diversity, most approaches to improving representation in videogames do not demand significant structural or environmental change, and thus generally continue to foster precarity. In thinking about precarity, I establish the concept of `(not)coping' to challenge the assumed dichotomy by which every instance of `not coping' designates a failure `to cope'. Rather than viewing `coping' and `not coping' as positive and negative binaries, I write `(not)coping' to highlight the liminal zone in between these affective states. (Not)coping is thus used to further describe the transformative affective spaces necessary for the refusal to cope within and against hegemony. I use qualitative mixed methods, combining semi-structured interviews, ethnographic participant observation, and discourse analysis to examine everyday struggles and how people can become affectively (re)orientated towards and away from certain videogame assemblages -- assemblages of objects, communities, and practices. My findings are presented as three main chapters, which investigate videogames in relationship conflicts, videogames in drunk spaces, and videogames in self-care discourses. In the field of game studies, methods of investigation are frequently configured around studying play, players, or the creation of play. However, this focus can ignore non-players, non-play relationship dynamics, and non-play-centric spaces that themselves also significantly shape videogame and play assemblages. Since the study of gaming lifeworlds crucially apprehends videogame assemblages as embedded in materiality, rather than separate from everyday life, I hope to demonstrate its use as a generative framework and model for feminist games, media, internet, cultural researchers to study videogames in culture.},

  abstract = {It has been proposed, and only minimally explored, that personality factors may play a role in determining an individual's sensitivity to and preference for capsaicin containing foods. We explored these relationships further here. Participants rated a number of foods and sensations on a generalized liking scale in a laboratory setting; after leaving the laboratory, they filled out an online personality survey, which included Arnett's Inventory of Sensation Seeking (AISS) and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ). Recently, we reported strong and moderate correlations between the liking of a spicy meal and the personality constructs of Sensation Seeking (AISS) and Sensitivity to Reward (SPSRQ), respectively. Here, we use moderation models to explore the relationships between personality traits, perceived intensity of the burn of capsaicin, and the liking and consumption of spicy foods. Limited evidence of moderation was observed; however differential effects of the personality traits were seen in men versus women. In men, Sensitivity to Reward associated more strongly with liking and consumption of spicy foods, while in women, Sensation Seeking associated more strongly with liking and intake of spicy foods. These differences suggest that in men and women, there may be divergent mechanisms leading to the intake of spicy foods; specifically, men may respond more to extrinsic factors, while women may respond more to intrinsic factors.},

The article examines the games' leveraging of these issues by way of their status as Canadian cultural documents, and therefore as participants in conversations about multicultural respect, but also in terms of two issues which exemplify gaps in the games' would-be respectful politics of difference: 1) questions of Indigenous ownership, priority and hierarchy; 2) the common space opera supposition that politicized ethnic identity positioning will have largely disappeared as populations become more mixed.},

  abstract = {The idea of games as ``difficult'' engagements has been popular in both our colloquial conversations around games, as well as some critical discussions.  Much research has been conducted on the function of difficulty as an aspect of immersion and engagement, but less has focused on the particular ludic mechanics that define the difficulty of a play experience.  It seems fair to say that some of the more visible games that fall into this category are FromSoftware's action RPG `Souls' series. Beginning with Demon's Souls (2009) and the subsequent Dark Souls trilogy that followed, the franchise has built itself on the idea that to play these games means to willingly embrace the kind of difficulty they afford.  It's an idea that is seeing considerable success, particularly with the most recent iteration Dark Souls III (2016).  It's a success that spawned new IPs in the same ludic style via FromSoftware's Bloodborne (2015), as well as a genre-like methodology that's been successfully adapted by other titles like Deck-13's Lords of the Fallen (2014) and The Surge (2017), as well as Team Ninja's Nioh (2017). The fact that these games continue to grow in popularity suggests that there is something compelling in their approach to challenge and difficulty that players find appealing, despite their common descriptors for being punishing.  So, what makes difficult games fun?},

Using human-to-NPC interactions within the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a case study, this paper seeks to define what aspects of a cozy game contribute towards public displays of aggression or kindness toward the game's characters. An examination of public forums dedicated to discussing villagers deemed ugly reveals the importance of parasocial connections in the utopian community planning aspects of Animal Crossing's gameplay. The resulting online discourse surrounding ethical treatment of villagers becomes part of players' conceptions of their role as social planner in-game, further solidifying which behaviors and objectives will yield them the coziest experience. Paratext, therefore, plays an active role in the conception and socialization of Animal Crossing players' utopian urban projects.},

  abstract = {Background and aims In recent years, we have witnessed a growing research interest in behavioral addictions and in pleasurable behaviors that generate a certain discomfort in the people who engage in them. The objective of this study was to assess if users of collectible card games, miniatures, and dice from the Star Wars Universe Games (SWUG) may also present criteria of addiction and if the presence of these criteria is related to demographic variables, game-playing habits, and other variables. Methods SWUG players were contacted through specialized gaming chats, and 218 of them completed the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale -- Short Form (IGDS-SF9), a scale that assesses motivation to engage in the game (Massively Multiplayer Online Motivations Scale), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Questionnaire, the Diener Satisfaction with Life Scale, and a question for the self-assessment of addiction. Results Significant predictors of addictive symptoms were the motivation to seek dissociation and (negatively) self-esteem. Users more significantly dedicate indirect hours to the game (thinking about the game, preparing material, etc.) than to actually playing. No participant could be considered pathologically addicted, as no one scored above the tentative cut-off point of the IGDS-SF9. Discussion and conclusions Despite the fact that many players considered themselves ``addicted'' and some presented various economic and family problems related to their activity, it was found that playing these games could not be equated to true addictive behavior, since no player had scores above the cut-off point. This finding contributes to current discussions about the tendency to overestimate excessive pleasurable behaviors.},

Public dissent from biotechnology  is, in this understanding, based exclusively in irrational fears. The  way to dispel these public fears is for scientists in the research  community and among corporate culture to engage in education of the  public. At one level, it is argued that public educational forums will  provide the information the public needs to make an informed choice  about the scientific, ethical, and social implications of biotechnology  or will provide guidance on such practical questions as whether to  consume genetically modified food. However, the educational agenda is  not quite that innocent of normative intent: rather, the assumption is  that information the public is provided about biotechnology will  persuade them of its benefits, its minimal risks, and its ultimate  prospects for reshaping our world for the good of all. Objections to  biotechnology will then largely dissipate, perhaps voiced occasionally  by extremists who will represent the inevitable Luddite resistance to  all things technological.},

The ``archaeogames'' I examine---which include Heaven's Vault (Inkle, 2019), Outer Wilds (Mobius Digital, 2019), The Forgotten City (Modern Storyteller, 2021), and Elden Ring (FromSoftware, 2022)---capture these concepts by implementing a variety of gameplay and narrative mechanics.

In this article, I build on a combination of games research, narrative theory, and migration studies to examine how these games enrich and complicate the cultural representation of migration. My focus is on how different scales of migration converge in game experiences (and in the narratives bound up with those experiences), immersing the player in moral dilemmas that have no clear solution or ideal outcome. I study four indie games that deploy this conceptual and emotional dynamic within different genres: Papers, Please (2013), Bury Me, My Love (2017), Frostpunk (2018), and Where the Water Tastes Like Wine (2018). By putting the player in touch with a variety of fictional migrants, these games walk a fine line between empathy for individual migrants and understanding of the large-scale factors that shape the lived experience of migration and the discourse surrounding it. Games thus mirror the real-world complexity of migration but also afford opportunities for more critical, or distanced, reflection than is possible in engaging with, for example, factual representation in the media.},

However, few studies have investigated their role in player-video game interactions. Two experiments were designed to investigate the influence of HUDs on player experience according to player expertise and game genre. Experiment 1 used eye-tracking and interviews to understand how and to what extent players use and experience HUDs in two types of commercial games: first-person shooter and real-time strategy games. Results showed that displaying a permanent HUD within the visual interface may improve the understanding of this environment by players. They also revealed that two HUD characteristics, namely composition and spatial organization, have particular influence on player experience. These critical characteristics were manipulated in experiment 2 to study more precisely the influence of HUD design choices on player experience. Results showed that manipulation of design of these HUD characteristics influences player experience in different ways according to player expertise and game genre. For games with HUDs that are perceived as very useful, the higher player expertise is, the more player experience is influenced. Recommendations for video game design based on these results are proposed.},

  abstract = {What is a social medium, and how may one moderate, isolate, and influence communicative processes within? Although scholars assume an inherent understanding of social media based on extant technology, there is no commonly accepted definition of what social media are, both functionally and theoretically, within communication studies. Given this lack of understanding, cogent theorizing regarding the uses and effects of social media has been limited. This work first draws on extant definitions of social media and subcategories (e.g., social network sites) from public relations, information technology, and management scholarship, as well as the popular press, to develop a definition of social media precise enough to embody these technologies yet robust enough to remain applicable in 2035. It then broadly explores emerging developments in the features, uses, and users of social media for which future theories will need to account. Finally, it divines and prioritizes challenges that may not yet be apparent to theorizing communication processes with and in mercurial social media. We address how social media may uniquely isolate and test communicative principles to advance our understanding of human--human and human--computer interaction. In all, this article provides a common framework to ground and facilitate future communication scholarship and beyond.},

The author puts pressure on the quasi-ecological rhetoric of the cloud by considering the material infrastructure that lurks behind every stroke of a keyboard and swipe of a touch screen. Developing a framework for ``cyberenvironmentalism,'' she shows that the cloud's footprint extends beyond corporate-owned data centers and high-speed networks to include small-scale, personal habits driven by values of connectivity and speed. The essay concludes with two case studies: first, Jennifer Egan's 2011 novel A Visit from the Goon Squad, whose PowerPoint chapter works to visualize the energy demands of a rapidly growing social media culture, and, second, the so-called high-frequency traders who today are making use of individual tweets, status updates, and other forms of everyday online communication to refine their market prediction algorithms and in turn profit enormously from the digital cloud.},

In the Philippines, a former Spanish and U.S. colony, recent history is resplendent with all manner of cataclysms - from natural disasters (earthquakes, typhoons) to mass destruction during war (Spanish-American War and World War II). This essay is concerned with the ways in which dreams and the dead are not just after-effects of events in linear-time nor exclusively human affects. Drawing on scholars of experimental ethnography and postcolonial film theory converging on Gilles Deleuze's ``time-image'', dreams authored by the dead here are engaged as agentive fabulators on decay, destruction, and loss -- first on the local level of experiencing disaster but further connecting that more broadly to loss of heritage sites and the possible future prospect of serial calamity augured by neoliberal development and climate change in the Pacific.},

  abstract = {The World Politics of Disco Elysium analyzes the distinctive political claims and original arguments on a wide range of international political issues of the highly-acclaimed Marxist video game Disco Elysium (2019), which takes place in a speculative fictional world anchored in a post-Soviet Estonian perspective. Disco Elysium (2019) has been repeatedly acclaimed as one of the best video games of all time. This detective role-playing game unfolds in a city ruined by a failed communist revolution and occupied by a foreign coalition. Furthering recent work in International Relations and popular culture, this book claims that the "cognitive estrangement" of speculative fiction can produce theoretical and political novelty, beyond merely reflecting existing political dynamics. By placing a metaphor for the Estonian capital Tallinn at the centre of a world, Disco Elysium produces an estranged Estonian perspective on world politics that challenges dominant Anglo-American views of International Relations, while also undermining the opposition between a coherent West and a colonized Rest. The contributors, from International Relations and Cultural Studies, discuss the game's claims on topics such as capitalism, (neo)liberalism, foreign intervention, law enforcement, fascism, colonialism, gender, disability, violence, memory, revolutionary politics, the European Union, political realism and international security. The World Politics of Disco Elysium will be of great interest to students and scholars researching the politics of popular culture, post-Soviet politics, non-Western International Relations, as well as game studies and cultural studies.},

  abstract = {In this essay, the author examines religion and how it is represented in the video game Ghost of Tsushima. With the representation term and its meaning from Stuart Hall, the author aims to analyse religious aspects in the game's environment and story, thus in the end picking out the representation that the games create of religion.      Using qualitative content analysis and semiotics, the author picks out temples, monks, amulets, and Kami as the main religious aspects that are found in-game. As it turns out the religious aspects in-game create the impression of Buddhist overturn in the Shinto religion. Many aspects stem from Buddhism, which correlate to the period and how Shinto assimilated Buddhist practises over time. The monks and temples are all of Buddhist origin, except for the official shrines to the Kami in-game. Overall, the Kami and Shinto, in general, are not present beyond being used for mechanics in the game while Buddhism is represented with more important aspects with major characters and meanings shown or talked about. The author does note that both religious traditions are presented more as merged, having become indistinguishable during the period in accordance with historical research. The essay concludes thus that religion is mostly represented in the characters like the warrior monk Norio and the monk Junshin who are followed more closely and represent religion through their actions and words.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes to maintain player's engagement by adapting game difficulty according to player's emotions assessed from physiological signals. The validity of this approach was first tested by analyzing the questionnaire responses, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and peripheral signals of the players playing a Tetris game at three difficulty levels. This analysis confirms that the different difficulty levels correspond to distinguishable emotions, and that, playing several times at the same difficulty level gives rise to boredom. The next step was to train several classifiers to automatically detect the three emotional classes from EEG and peripheral signals in a player-independent framework. By using either type of signals, the emotional classes were successfully recovered, with EEG having a better accuracy than peripheral signals on short periods of time. After the fusion of the two signal categories, the accuracy raised up to 63\%.},

As one of the signature issues of the twenty-first century, ecological deterioration is seemingly everywhere, but it is rarely considered via the realm of interactive digital play. In Playing Nature, Alenda Y. Chang offers groundbreaking methods for exploring this vital overlap. Arguing that games need to be understood as part of a cultural response to the growing ecological crisis, Playing Nature seeds conversations around key environmental science concepts and terms. Chang suggests several ways to rethink existing game taxonomies and theories of agency while revealing surprising fundamental similarities between game play and scientific work. Gracefully reconciling new media theory with environmental criticism, Playing Nature examines an exciting range of games and related art forms, including historical and contemporary analog and digital games, alternate- and augmented-reality games, museum exhibitions, film, and science fiction. Chang puts her surprising ideas into conversation with leading media studies and environmental humanities scholars like Alexander Galloway, Donna Haraway, and Ursula Heise, ultimately exploring manifold ecological futures---not all of them dystopian.},

  abstract = {Despite the huge sales of various historical videogames (e.g. Sid Meier's Civilization, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed) the discipline of history has shown surprisingly little interest in this new mode of historical expression. These videogames are perhaps the most popular contemporary histories, but there seems to be a perception of the form as unsuitable for consideration as a legitimate form of historical narrative. This article attempts to explore the videogame's legitimacy as a historical form. This is done by starting with Galloway's (2006) informatics critique of Civilization, which has serious implications for the videogame as a historical form. This is followed by evidence from both educators and players, which affirms that playing the game already constitutes a historical experience that ties into a larger historical discourse. Finally, by using a perspective that rethinks empiricism and written representationalism and that endorses a position that frees up intellectual space for the postmodern historian, this article attempts to address issues surrounding the suitability of the videogame as a historical form. This essay seeks to show that these are inherent `flaws' attributable to history (which can be thought of as representation), rather than any particular form. This leads to an exploration of the similarities in the algorithmic process of creative construction of the game-based history to our other more traditional modes of history. By re-evaluating Galloway's work we are also rethinking empirical-analytical historical thinking and practice. Doing so allows us to begin to explore important questions about and affirm that the videogame can be a recognisable metonymic narrative device and thus a suitable form for history.},

We document the growth of ChatGPT's consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10\% of the world's adult population. Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53\% to more than 70\% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation topic and find that ``Practical Guidance,'' ``Seeking Information,'' and ``Writing'' are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80\% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots' unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional search engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.},

The ludic elements of the game, including weapon or enemy design and their compatibility with reflecting an Indian ethos in video game mechanisms have also been discussed. The treatment of Indian mythology is extensively explored, with an eye to locating its space in Indian mythic tradition. Through an analysis of narrative storytelling in the game, aspects such as the foregrounding of a female protagonist and the apparent progressive feminist attitude of the game have been scrutinised. The sociocultural depiction of India and its implications and contexts relating to contemporary understanding of the space of the subcontinent has also been taken into consideration. A careful study of the game within the contemporary post-colonial discourse constitutes a part of the article. We also undertake a comparative study with another Indian mythic video game,               Unrest               (Pyrodactyl 2014), to better understand the issues surrounding the treatment of mythic and historical elements. The article both contemplates the missed opportunities and future potentials, for example, in terms of more nuanced and accurate representation and the balance between ludic execution and representational possibilities, as experienced in the ludo-narrative experience offered by the game.},

All of the letters are in lower case. 7. There are no double consonants. 8. It includes diphthong, triphthongs, quadriphthongs and even quintiphthongs for the abbreviation of phonetic components. 9. It includes some words and abbreviations in Latin. As a result, identifying the language and solving the writing system required some ingenuity and lateral thinking, but both were duly revealed. The writing system is rather more singular and less intuitive than modern systems, which may explain why it failed to become culturally ubiquitous and ultimately became obsolete. On the other hand, a significant vestige of the language has survived into the modern era, because its lexicon has been sequestered into the many modern languages of Mediterranean Europe. Here, the language and writing system are explained, so that other scholars can explore the manuscript for its linguistic and informative content.},

The Slender Man takes on important cultural meanings in the age of the Internet - meanings often neglected when the crime version of the story went reported in the media. The revisions that they made to it helps to suggest an iterative folk telling tradition. Because the Slender Man storytelling process has become both crowd sourced and participatory - taking place at what we identify as a "digital campfire" - the interpretations and analyses are not meant to be static, but to provide an explanation of how Internet mythologies develop and prosper. This book introduces unique attributes of digital culture and establishes a needed framework for studies of other Internet memes and mythologies. -- Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {This article examines how the process of platformisation is manifesting in videogame development. Rather than reinforcing a top-down perspective of platformisation centred on distribution platforms like app stores, we focus on often overlooked game-making tools and the independent, entrepreneurial, and fringe communities that govern and use them. We draw on case studies of Unity and Twine, two such tools that have transformed videogame creation and distribution. By considering how they complicate existing understandings and definitions of both `platform' and `platformisation', we move beyond reductive narratives that frame platformisation as a fixed, hegemonic process. Instead, we reveal a much more ambiguous and complex relationship between game makers and the platforms they use.},

We carry out a data-driven analysis of a prominent game release, No Man's Sky, using topic modeling based text mining of Steam reviews. Importantly, our approach treats player perception not as a single sentiment but identifies multiple topics of interest that evolve differently over time, and allows us to contrast patching of the game to evolution of the topics.},

It resembled Pseudomonas cepacia on the selective and differential medium OFPBL, producing yellow colonies after 48 to 72 h of incubation. Isolates were characterized biochemically, by DNA hybridization, and by cellular fatty acid analysis. A review of the clinical status of selected patients colonized by P. gladioli did not reveal any apparent association of this organism with infectious complications of cystic fibrosis. Thus, the clinical implications may differ depending on which of these two closely related species is reported by laboratories. Determination of the fatty acid profile of isolates by gas chromatography may be a useful adjunct to biochemical characterization as a means of identification. In contrast to P. cepacia, most isolates of P. gladioli contained 3-OH C10:0 fatty acid under the growth conditions used.},

We developed a murder mystery game where users interact with LLM-based non-playable characters (NPCs) through interrogation, clue-gathering, and exploration. Two versions were tested: one using speech recognition and another with traditional dialog boxes. While both provided similar social presence, users felt more immersed with speech recognition but found it overwhelming, while the dialog version was more challenging. Slow NPC response times were a source of frustration, highlighting the need for faster generation or better masking for a seamless experience.},

The developers also designed the gameplay mechanics such as level-up system, map design, and side quests based on these narrative traits, ultimately making the goal of the narrative and the gameplay mechanics cohesive.},

Through the use of examples, we discuss the ways in which these purposes are supported by genre classification and conceptualization and the implications for video games. Suggestions for improved conceptualizations such as family resemblances, prototype theory, faceted classification, and appeal factors for video game genres are considered, with discussions of strengths and weaknesses. This analysis helps inform potential future practical applications for describing video games at cultural heritage institutions such as libraries, museums, and archives, as well as furthering the understanding of video game genre and genre classification for game studies at large.},

  abstract = {Since the publication of Roman Jakobson's famous 1956 essay ``Two Aspects of Language and Two Types of Aphasic Disturbances'', we have tended to read the relationship between metaphor and metonymy as a dialectical one. The essay argues that this approach stands in need of revision, since metonymy, as a trope---and as a trope, moreover, of contingency---undermines the dialectical relationship between the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic axes. This has far-reaching implications, specifically for the assessment of literature and its ethics. Since metaphor functions structurally analogous to dialectics itself, metonymy and its role in realism and neorealism might offer us a way to think an ``ethics of contingency'' that acknowledges the role of contingency, rather that suppressing it and its role in preventing closure through sublation.},

We show that published researches have been studying only a limited set of game genres and that they especially focus on online games. We then expose the different ways game studies are talking about games through a topic model analysis of our corpus. We test two hypotheses to explain the concentration of research on singular objects: path dependence and trading zone. We describe integrative properties of the focus on common objects but stress also the scientific limits met by this tendency.},

Its chapters explores the function and origin of myths like the unity and separateness of the English, the barbarism of the Celtic Fringe, the innate desire of Jews to murder Christian children as part of their Pesach ritual. Populated by wonders like a tempest formed of blood, a Saracen pope, strange creatures suspended between the animal and the human, and corpses animated with uncanny life, Hybridity, Identity and Monstrosity in Medieval Britain maps how collective identities form through violent exclusions, and details the price paid by those who find themselves denied the possibility of belonging.},

From early Welsh poetry to the twenty-first century anim\'e series produced by the Fate franchise, the essays in this collection explore the continuities that make the material recognisable in different times and places and the astonishing variety of adaptations that have made the Arthurian story popular in large parts of the world. Divided into 3 main sections: Arthurian Texts and Material Contexts: 600-1600; The European World of Arthur: 1200-1800; Crossing Genres, Crossing Centuries: 1500-2018 the book focuses on the moments of transition in which Arthurian material has moved across temporal, material, and geographical boundaries. Although broadly chronological, the sections are bound together by their thematic focal points and contain different examples of textual and visual representations of Arthur that illustrate the breadth and scope of Arthurian adaptation.},

The collection focuses on multiple assemblages of objects, media, materials, practices, relations, devices, and atmospheres, spanning methods and topics involving food to activism, knitting to ghosts, theater to documents, collaging to corridors. Through hands-on discussions of the practicalities, ethics, and politics of doing social research, the catalogue showcases a wide range of examples of what methods might mean and do. It builds a case for an understanding of contemporary social research as interdisciplinary, responsive, dynamic, vital, and urgent in studying and shaping social worlds. Goldsmiths Sociology Department is internationally recognized as being at the forefront of some of the most daring, original and unconventional methodological innovation. Their unbounded approach to social research offers textured yet clear paths through the problems and issues before us, as contributors present the methodological puzzles they have become knotted with. The short and imaginative case studies offer new ways of teaching, learning, and doing lively and rigorous research. This is research as close-up observations, infrastructural interventions and imaginative play.

Analysis of emotion in video games often focuses on narrative and representative elements, and emotions regularly experienced by gamers such as frustration, victory, joy of discovery etc. This paper uses close textual analysis with support from cognitive theories of emotion to analyse the ludic and mechanical, in addition to representative and narrative, qualities of these games. By doing so it is shown how guilt, grief and loneliness have more chance of being elicited from the player, with emphasis on the use of ambiguity and violation of player expectations. It is hoped that this approach will encourage further work of this type in an area so that both theoretical work and future development might benefit.},

And yet despite (or perhaps, in part, because of) its urgency, science communicators have found it quite difficult to convey this threat effectively to the broader public. While Guerrilla Games's Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) does an excellent job of creating opportunities for players to reflect on ecocritical themes, the disconnect that exists between its plot and its core gameplay loops somewhat blunt its effectiveness as an instrument of activism. In particular, its emphasis on combat diverts attention from what Rob Nixon (2011) calls the ``slow violence'' of climate change in favor of escapist power fantasies. I suggest that this disconnect between the game's mechanics and its themes point to the need to invent new modes of interaction more suited to showcasing the unprecedented scale upon which cli-fi stories take place. As one potential model of a relevant mechanic, I would like to nominate inkle's Heaven's Vault (2019), an ``archeogame'' (Reinhard, 2018) in which the impact of events long distant in time and space reverberate into the future and the only way to fight back against a cataclysmic environmental disaster is to understand the entrenched political and ideological institutions that brought it into existence over the course of millennia as well as the place of the individual within those institutions as potential agents of change.},

It points to ludic hopes and activities, and it causes us to question our values, our ethics. In comparison, the concept of the magic circle seems static and overly formalist. Structures may be necessary to begin gameplay, but we cannot stop at structures as a way of understanding the gameplay experience. Because of that, we cannot say that games are magic circles, where the ordinary rules of life do not apply. Of course they apply, but in addition to, in competition with, other rules and in relation to multiple contexts, across varying cultures, and into different groups, legal situations, and homes.},

This article concerns a new conception of the fourth wall in game-relevant terms, being conceived as expansions and contractions of the magic circle. Expansions of the magic circle occur when the synthetic world of the game expands beyond the screen, encompassing the technological apparatus of the console/PC or the paratexts packaged with the game. Contractions occur when the magic circle shrinks behind the display, e.g. Sonic tapping his knuckles upon the screen or the game crashing. In unpacking and re-conceiving the notion of the fourth wall in gaming terms, this article hopes to provide a valuable analytical perspective concerning the use of these expansions and contractions by developers and players, and their impact on wider media culture.},

For much of the series, his rage drives much of the narrative and game dynamics, as Kratos destroys the entire Greek pantheon. The latest iteration of the series moves Kratos into Norse mythology and introduces a son. This father--son relationship allows the developers to ruminate upon the toxic masculinity that has defined much of the series' past. Kratos' trajectory moves from the flatness of one defining characteristic, rage, to an introspective consideration of this emotion and its consequences. A parabolic supporting cast set the stage, each illustrating an aspect of toxicity; as explored, the mother--son relationship between Freya and her son, Baldur, is given a poignant twist. Overall, this article investigates how God of War articulates characteristics of toxic masculinity, explores its repercussions, and offers lessons for its rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {The primary text of this thesis is Skyrim, a fantasy roleplaying game released in 2011 to huge commercial success and critical acclaim. Through this text, the project explores the intersection of medievalist fantasy, politics, and whiteness. It investigates the parallels between political medievalisms, playful medievalisms, and the ways in which medieval fantasy is used to reinvent or reaffirm white identities. The Middle Ages, as a time period, an imagined geographic space, and an ideological concept, is often nostalgically recalled as a key element in Western nationalism and identity formation. Skyrim provides a major case study through which to interrogate the tropes of medieval fantasy in order to understand how the genre situates itself as a space of creativity and resistance, but in fact maintains conservative social values. Furthermore, it asks how players engage in identity play in medieval fantasy games, and to what extent Skyrim's politics encourage discussion and reflection. This thesis is highly interdisciplinary in its form and utilises multiple methodologies to explore the construction of the self and the other through medievalism in fantasy. Traditional humanities methods are combined with a survey of players' narrative choices and modes of identification with characters and factions within Skyrim, as well as analysis of `gamer'-activism in popular politics. Ultimately, although the games explored are established to be highly conservative in their modes of racial representation, the thesis finds that players are actively engaged in identity play. Although this is limited in many ways by game design---especially where medieval fantasy genre conventions are heeded---the potential for game worlds to destabilise racial boundaries and provide a space for identity play is acknowledged, opening up several avenues for further research in the fields of enquiry.},

I will argue why in game research the current use of the term magic circle is problematic. We can understand the term differently when returning to the context in which Huizinga introduced the magic circle as ritual play-ground. According to him ritual is play and play is ritual. Referring back to his work Homo Ludens (1938) I will discuss the various relationships between role-play and ritual performance. I will argue that fantasy role-playing consists of collections of performances or ritual acts, in which players construct the game/play space, identities and meaning.},

  abstract = {Currently, game research is characterized by the (re)construction of contested boundaries such as the ``magic circle'' of the game experience. These boundaries create dichotomies, for instance, between the real and the imaginary that hide the complexity of actual play, design and research. In this thesis I propose to go ``beyond the magic circle'' in order to understand games and play from a network perspective. My case study is role-play in the online game World of Warcraft (Blizzard Entertainment 2004), whereby players act out the roles of their Fantasy characters. I understand Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) as networks of social interaction in which players (human actors) interact both with each other and with the system (nonhuman actors). Through interaction, role-players are creating meaning and social bonds that stretch out far beyond dichotomies such as in-character and out-of-character, in-game and out of game, real and imaginary, leisure and work or education, virtual and material, online and offline. The emergence of Fantasy role-playing games, of which the pen and paper game Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D, 1974) is the first and World of Warcraft (WoW, Blizzard Entertainment, 2004) is one of the latest incarnations, ties in with the development of what sociologist Manuel Castells termed the network society. Through rich empirical case studies in his trilogy The Information Age: economy, society and culture (1996, 1997 and 1998), he mapped how since the late 1960s we have been witnessing a shift from hierarchies to networks in all sectors of society. Castells' work is part of a growing body of network theory in which our society, including science itself, is understood as a complex system shaped by processes within and between actor networks that are often powered by information and communication technologies. In order to study MMORPGs as networks, I made use of Actor Network Theory as it is formulated within science and technology studies (Callon 1986, Law 1987, Latour 1987, 2005), Thomas Gieryn's concept of boundary work (Gieryn 1983, 1999), Erving Goffman's work on social interaction (Goffman 1956, 1974), and the concept of ``situatedness,'' a crucial addition that Donna Haraway made to network theory, which aims to make visible how scholars are positioned in constantly morphing network structures (Haraway 1991). This thesis contributes to 1) an understanding of online role-playing games as networks that interact with daily life, Fantasy game culture, and the broader technological and socio-cultural developments over the last thirty years; 2) a description and analysis of role-play as a specific MMORPG play style that is characterized by its negotiation principles, and thus to understand the roles, conventions, identities, and interpersonal relationships that self-proclaimed role-players negotiate in and through the systems of a commercially distributed game; and, finally, 3) an understanding of how collaborative play, design, and game research are closely intertwined. Going ``beyond the magic circle'' has profound implications for both epistemology and education in game research and design. A network epistemology asks for interdisciplinary academic work that combines not only scholarship from the humanities and social sciences, but also from computer sciences. Furthermore, it calls for a societal contextualization of scholarship and a connecting of fundamental and applied theorization both ``inside'' and ``outside'' academia, done by players, designers, and academics, roles that more often can be found in one person. A networked education teaches a specialization in the context of other research and design disciplines, as the ability and passion to create unexpected blends is crucial for future innovative developments in play, design, and research.},

One of the key concerns expressed in both formal and informal literature surrounding these games has been the concept of accuracy in relation to the represented cultural-heritage. However, limited dialogue between videogame developers, gamers and cultural-heritage professionals has meant that there is surprisingly little primary data regarding how these groups are constructing, experiencing or analysing ideas of accuracy. This paper aims to provide a foundation for understanding how and why accuracy is conceptualised, implemented and assessed in videogames by the developers, gamers and cultural-heritage professionals who are involved in their creation, consumption and critique. To achieve this, the article critically analyses 156 interviews conducted with members of the videogame industry, gamers and cultural-heritage professionals. This analysis uses the concepts of reconstructionist, constructionist, and deconstructionist history to frame responses to the questions what is accuracy in cultural-heritage videogames?' and does accuracy matter in cultural-heritage videogames - why or why not?'.},

This book examines the complexity of World of Warcraft from a variety of perspectives, exploring the cultural and social implications of the proliferation of ever more complex digital gameworlds. The contributors have immersed themselves in the World of Warcraft universe, spending hundreds of hours as players (leading guilds and raids, exploring moneymaking possibilities in the in-game auction house, playing different factions, races, and classes), conducting interviews, and studying the game design---as created by Blizzard Entertainment, the game's developer, and as modified by player-created user interfaces. The analyses they offer are based on both the firsthand experience of being a resident of Azeroth and the data they have gathered and interpreted. The contributors examine the ways that gameworlds reflect the real world---exploring such topics as World of Warcraft as a "capitalist fairytale" and the game's construction of gender; the cohesiveness of the gameworld in terms of geography, mythology, narrative, and the treatment of death as a temporary state; aspects of play, including "deviant strategies" perhaps not in line with the intentions of the designers; and character---both players' identification with their characters and the game's culture of naming characters. The varied perspectives of the contributors---who come from such fields as game studies, textual analysis, gender studies, and postcolonial studies---reflect the breadth and vitality of current interest in MMOGs.},

One application domain that could prove fruitful is to video games, where LLMs could be used to provide conversational responses from non-playable characters (NPCs) that are more dynamic and diverse. Additionally, LLMs could allow players the autonomy to converse in open-ended conversations potentially improving player immersion and agency. However, due to their recent commercial popularity, the consequences (both negative and positive) of using LLMs in video games from a player's perspective is currently unclear. On from this, we analyse player feedback to the use of LLM-driven NPC responses in a commercially available video game. We discuss findings and implications, and generate guidelines for designers incorporating LLMs into NPC dialogue.},

However, defining exactly which challenges are important and which aspects of gaming experience are affected is largely under-explored. In this paper, we investigate if altering the level of challenge in a videogame influences people's experience of immersion. Our first study demonstrates that simply increasing the physical demands of the game by requiring gamers to interact more with the game does not result in increased immersion. In a further two studies, we use time pressure to make games more physically and cognitively challenging. We find that the addition of time pressure increases immersion as predicted. We argue that the level of challenge experienced is an interaction between the level of expertise of the gamer and the cognitive challenge encompassed within the game.},

The collection focuses on the ways in which gamers engage with, play with, recreate, subvert, reverse and direct the historical past, and what effect this has on the ways in which we go about constructing the present or imagining a future. What can World War Two strategy games teach us about the reality of this complex and multifaceted period? Do the possibilities of playing with the past change the way we understand history? If we embody a colonialist's perspective to conquer 'primitive' tribes in Colonization, does this privilege a distinct way of viewing history as benevolent intervention over imperialist expansion? The fusion of these two fields allows the editors to pose new questions about the ways in which gamers interact with their game worlds. Drawing these threads together, the collection concludes by asking whether digital games - which represent history or historical change - alter the way we, today, understand history itself"--},

The most familiar surviving stories that connect us to our ancestors take the form of folklore and mythology. Games, too, have served many of the same functions as storytelling. In modern times, games and storytelling are no less prevalent, although the particular forms they take and functions they fulfill have been vastly expanded. Narrative gaming has become extremely popular, allowing for the consumption of both regional heritage and global multiculturalism. This essay will explore the roles of these contemporary narratives and provide an analysis of the transition from the traditional narrative to the live role-playing game.},

The horror of BEN Drowned is rooted in the rhetoric of glitches, those infuriating moments when the failures of technology interrupt gameplay and otherwise distort the world of a game. The emergence of the glitch horror genre and the popularity of narratives like BEN Drowned are manifestations of collective anxieties surrounding the fallibility and restrictions of digital technology; it is fiction about the fear of glitchy games, corrupted files, and bad coding. This paper explores glitch horror through the lenses of fan fiction and participatory culture, metafiction, the Freudian uncanny, the fallibility of technology, and fundamental rules of gaming and play.},

Three qualities in particular are identified; they center on the role of the player in contributing to the finished form, the nature of the player's canvas, and the sensations that return back to the player when traversing the video game field. It is argued that the concepts used to define the formal qualities of the video game can be deployed to distinguish where a video game succeeds or fails.

  abstract = {This thesis explores Nintendo's past and present games and marketing, linking them to the broader trend of the commodification of nostalgia. The use of nostalgia by Nintendo is a key component of the company's brand, fueling fandom and a compulsive drive to recapture the past. By making a significant investment in cultivating a generation of loyal fans, Nintendo positioned themselves to later capitalize on consumer nostalgia. The commodification of fan nostalgia is evident across multiple platforms, from the development of the Virtual Console digital game storefront to the use of pastiche and remediation in multi-generation, Nintendo developed franchises. Additionally, Nintendo frequently places their heritage front and center and creates tightly controlled spaces to guide fan discourse and continue to shape the Nintendo legacy on their terms.},

However, few studies have been conducted on the mechanism of game loyalty of playbors. This study investigates the effects of game experience and fanwork creation on game loyalty through the mediation effect of three types of perceived value: functional, hedonic, and intrinsic value. Based on the Chinese video game industry, the analysis shows that game experience and fanwork creation positively influence playbors' game loyalty. Further, while intrinsic value plays a partial mediating role between game experience and game loyalty, it has a complete mediation effect between fanwork creation and game loyalty. Our findings have important implications for engagement and loyalty research in the context of the Chinese video game industry. \copyright{} 2022},

  abstract = {This paper responds to calls for greater clarity about the application of theory and method in research on mediated communication about climate-change. Specifically, it identifies conceptual and methodological challenges for researching visual representations of climate change. We suggest current research is impeded by a lack of methodological explication and an unclear relationship between theories of visual meaning and the application of social science methods such as content analysis and frame analysis. As a first step towards addressing these issues, we review existing research to identify the methodological procedures that require explication in order to support the replication of studies and the comparison of findings. We then draw on the seminal work of Roland Barthes to examine how theories of visual meaning may be integrated into social-scientific research methods. Specifically, we demonstrate how Barthes' concepts of denotation, connotation and mythology may be related to research concerns about the selection of visual content, the classification of image frames, audience responses, and analyses of ideological meaning. The conclusion highlights further possibilities for developing a robust form of visual analysis that meets the standards of social scientific research while addressing the fundamental insights about visual meaning derived from cultural theories of meaning.},

Whilst technically illegal and often carrying negative connotations, modding constitutes a moral grey area that is commonly accepted, often encouraged by proprietary owners and forum-centred gaming communities. Literature reflects a disparity between outsider and insider perceptions of modding, with a paucity of studies reflecting insider perspectives. Using Reddit forum data, this study contributes insight into perceptions of modding held by gamers and `modders', as described in their words and their territory. Thematic analysis revealed four main themes relating to unfairness in the vendor community, modders as antagonists, differences between modders and modding as forms of self-defence. Conclusions include that modding appears to have both pro- and antisocial applications, but many people and organisations demonise modders as a homogeneous group, which may encourage antisocial behaviours.},

But many studies do not take into account audience expectations of fact-checking or their engagement with news generally in the context of a national media system or its political culture. Our study makes an intervention into debates about fact-checking by focussing on the effectiveness this type of journalism has with audiences who were attentive to the news in the UK's media system during a key point in a major health crisis. Drawing on a six-week news diary study (N\,=\,200) during the coronavirus pandemic, our study concluded that the UK's impartial media ecology and public service ethos creates an environment where audiences are largely receptive to journalists' fact-checking and countering misinformation. Yet our content analysis of television news (N\,=\,1259) during the pandemic found most broadcasters did not regularly challenge or question the government's decision-making. We argue that since audiences favoured robust forms of journalistic scrutiny, broadcasters could more prominently fact-check claims and question dubious statements without undermining trust in journalism. We recommend scholars should pay more attention to understanding the audience reception of fact-checking across different media and political systems.},

  abstract = {This article considers the figure of the monster and monstrosity as a phenomenon as an entangled effect of kinship and reproduction, and thus as conveying specific understandings of gender, sexuality and race. While non-heterosexual reproduction and family-making has long been viewed as monstrous, increasing LGBTQ rights and recognition has instead insisted on its normality. Engaging with feminist and queer monster theory, and building on ethnographic research in Stockholm, Sweden, this article considers the monstrous remains within contemporary queer kinship. In particular, it proposes that when choice and intent rather than biological `facts' constitute the foundation of (queer) family, sexual and racial difference does not cease to exist, but rather, re-emerges as monstrous attachments and embodiments. To sketch a larger argument about the potential limits of ideas about social construction, the article hones in on two examples. First, it shows that gestation and childbirth, as monstrous embodiments, can pose problems for families that insist on parental equality through the perceived sameness of shared intent. Secondly it proposes that in the context of Sweden, reproduction through donor-insemination is built on a cultural idea of white sperm as both neutral and desirable. These examples, the article suggest, point to some remaining irreconcilable dimensions embedded in the fantasy of queer kinship that, like monsters, haunt its queer normative forms. In closing, it argues for a reconsideration of hopeful monstrosities by considering both queer reproduction and the sexual and racial differences with which it inevitably engages can instead be understood as somatechnical, as kinship technologies that are inevitably entangled in the biopolitics of (queer) nation-making and its natrualised whiteness.},

  abstract = {The analysis of digital games is a widely used method in the field of game studies and an important instrument to study games and game-related topics. However, existing methodological work showcases a divergency of perspectives on game analyses, hindering the development of clear guidelines on how to actually conduct them. This lack of methodological consensus is fueled further by several complexities when analyzing games, such as the active participation that is required on the part of the researchers. Therefore, the current paper proposes the Digital Game Analysis Protocol (DiGAP), a methodological toolkit that, compared to existing methodological frameworks, provides researchers with sufficient flexibility and adaptability in order to cater to a game analysis' specific focus and needs. DiGAP's goal is twofold: to make researchers reflect on the potential impact of their methodological choices on the analysis and interpretation of game content, and to promote the transparent reporting of game analyses in academic manuscripts. Based on previous methodological scholarship, the authors' prior game analysis experience and brainstorm meetings between members of our interdisciplinary author team, DiGAP consists of 31 items categorized in seven sections: (1) Rationale \& objectives, (2) Researcher background, (3) Game selection, (4) Boundaries, (5) Analysis approach, (6) Coding techniques \& data extraction and (7) Reporting \& transparency. Due to its comprehensive setup and its reflexive nature, DiGAP may be used as a (didactic) checklist to make insights from the field of game studies regarding game analyses accessible to a broader range of research fields (e.g., communication and human-computer interaction). This, in turn, makes it equally valuable for (student) researchers unfamiliar with the method of game analysis as well as more experienced game scholars.},

Coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the release of the film, Rayna Denison curates this new collection to critically reflect on Princess Mononoke's significance within and beyond Japanese culture. The collection investigates the production, and re-production, processes involved in the making ofPrincess Mononoke into a global phenomenon and reevaluates the film's significance within a range of global markets, animation techniques, and cultures. In revisiting this undeniably important film, the collection sheds light on the tensions within anime and the cultural and social issues that Princess Mononoke explores, from environmental protection to globalization to the representation of marginalized groups. In this remarkable new collection, Princess Mononoke is examined as a key player during a major turning point in Japanese animation history.},

First, the conflicting representations of the youths of Homer and Marge in two `flashback' episodes (`The Way We Was' and `That 90's [ sic] Show') are examined. The logical quandaries presented by departing from a floating timeline and introducing fixed (but multiple and contradictory) historical reference points in individual episodes are outlined, and it is suggested that it may be better to accept the fictional paradoxes created rather than to try to resolve them. Second, the episodes featuring `Sideshow Bob' are surveyed, and Bob is offered as being granted the unusual capacity (within The Simpsons' fictional universe) to experience the passage of time and accumulate and retain an eventful history. This is contrasted with the temporal experiences of the Simpsons themselves, for whom there is eventfulness without progression. The article concludes by suggesting that The Simpsons' status as an animated programme allows it to exhibit in a particularly pure and sustained form some of the relationship to time, history and the everyday of situation comedy and television more broadly.},

  abstract = {In the late nineteenth century, both the United States and Canada established a practice of removing indigenous children from their homes and families and enrolling them in boarding schools intended to train them in dominant White culture. Massive harms were perpetrated by the schools through abuse, neglect, and wrongful deaths. Despite the efforts of indigenous creative and scholarly writers, this troubling history continues to receive little attention in public education, perpetuating the experience of marginalization and silence among indigenous youth.The Trickster Remembers project seeks to address this dilemma by bringing a more nuanced version of the boarding school experience to the primarily White community of tabletop gamers through creation of a tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG). Drawing from fiction and autobiography describing the boarding school experience, as well as culturally specific story collections, all produced by indigenous writers, Trickster Remembers is a praxis experiment: a cultural intervention through the creation of a cultural object or phenomena founded in critical t heor y.This paper analyzes the effectiveness of Trickster Remembers---designed, tested, and analyzed by the author---as an intervention tool aimed at fostering understanding and empathy. First, the author presents the intersections of narrative, performance, and game studies theories that form its critical foundations. Next, a description of the game and its design process is offered. The third section analyzes the game's effectiveness in fulfilling its goals using excerpts from actual play during two separate playtest sessions. The final section provides a critical reflection on the project's limitations and ethical ramifications, as well as possible theoretical implications.},

  abstract = {What would it mean to take zombies seriously? Cultural savants have noted the rise of the zombie in American popular culture in the twenty-first century. And many scholars have found the zombie useful as a lumbering, empty-headed metaphor that could signify just about anything. The zombie might look like a loved ovne, but their flesh is rotting and their individualism has tragically withered away. Before I came to zombology, I was already fascinated by an American obsession with preventing the decay of the corpse through an exceptional devotion to embalming. I argue that the intersection of the new zombie-ism, the rapid decline of embalming, and the mass trauma of 9/11 is significant. Playing with zombies along a spectrum from fright to humor allows Americans to work through not a crisis of meaning, but a crisis of being. The cult of individualism no longer needs a perfect biological body.},

  abstract = {For a long time, empirical science lay outside the field of scholarship concerned with European Romanticism. Recently, however, Romanticism's traditional reconstruction in terms of an exclusively literary absolute has been challenged and revised. It is now more frequently acknowledged that even the notion of               romantische Poesie               , which had always appeared to affirm poetry as Romanticism's sovereign form, quickly outgrew any stringently restrictive reference to literature. This chapter examines the self-grounding and self-depending character of Romantic scientific discourse. Modern scientific discourse has especially sought to repress such self-consciousness. Romantic science rather becomes an especially interesting variety of Romantic experience, because it seeks to preserve consciousness of the temporal and operational nature of its own statements, while not giving up on the positivity of description, the possibility of veridical reference to objects, or the sensible reality of material nature.},

Whether they are providing new spaces to imagine and practice alternative forms of living, or reproducing ecomodernist fantasies, games as well as player cultures are increasingly tuned in to the most pressing environmental concerns. This book brings together chapters by a diverse group of established and emerging authors to develop a growing body of scholarship that explores the shape, impact, and cultural context of ecogames. The book comprises four thematic sections, Today's Challenges: Games for Change, Future Worlds: New Imaginaries, The Nonhuman Turn, and Critical Metagaming Practices. Each section explores different aspects of ecocritical engagement in and through games. As a result, the book's comprehensive scope covers a variety of angles, methodologies, and case studies, significantly expanding the field of green media studies.},

Drawing on detailed case studies from across the genre, contributors from a variety of backgrounds offer insights into how the study of zombies in the context of video games informs an analysis of their impact on contemporary popular culture. Issues such as gender, politics, intellectual property law, queer theory, narrative storytelling and worldbuilding, videogame techniques and technology, and man's relation to monsters are closely examined in their relation to zombie video games. Breaking new ground in the study of video games and popular culture, this volume will be of interest to researchers in a broad range of areas including media, popular culture, video games, and media psychology"--},

The long discursive Introductions and footnotes by Nicaise and Joubert, and footnotes and explanatory insertions by this translator supplement Guy's text with a fine history of French surgery. Indeed, as Nicaise wrote in the historical Introduction to his edition of Pierre Franco, if we were to combine the introductions in his editions of Henri de Mondeville, Pierre Franco, and Guy de Chauliac with Malgaigne's Introduction to his edition of Ambroise Pare, we will have a complete history of European Surgery before the modern era. Guy's era was that of the Great Plague, and his book was written after its first invasion.

  abstract = {Background Eosinophilic gastritis and duodenitis are characterized by gastrointestinal mucosal eosinophilia, chronic symptoms, impaired quality of life, and a lack of adequate treatments. Mast-cell activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of the conditions. AK002 (lirentelimab) is an anti--Siglec-8 antibody that depletes eosinophils and inhibits mast cells and that has shown potential in animal models as a treatment for eosinophilic gastritis and duodenitis. Methods In this phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned adults who had symptomatic eosinophilic gastritis, eosinophilic duodenitis, or both conditions in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive four monthly infusions of low-dose AK002, high-dose AK002, or placebo. The primary end point was the change in gastrointestinal eosinophil count from baseline to 2 weeks after the final dose; to maximize statistical power, we evaluated this end point in the placebo group as compared with the combined AK002 group. Secondary end points were treatment response ({$>$}30\% reduction in total symptom score and {$>$}75\% reduction in gastrointestinal eosinophil count) and the change in total symptom score. Results Of the 65 patients who underwent randomization, 43 were assigned to receive AK002 and 22 were assigned to receive placebo. The mean percentage change in gastrointestinal eosinophil count was -86\% in the combined AK002 group, as compared with 9\% in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -98 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -121 to -76; P{$<$}0.001). Treatment response occurred in 63\% of the patients who received AK002 and in 5\% of the patients who received placebo (difference, 58 percentage points; 95\% CI, 36 to 74; P{$<$}0.001). The mean change in total symptom score was -48\% with AK002 and -22\% with placebo (least-squares mean difference, -26 percentage points; 95\% CI, -44 to -9; P=0.004). Adverse events associated with AK002 were similar to those with placebo, with the exception of higher percentages of patients having mild-to-moderate infusion-related reactions with AK002 (60\% in the combined AK002 group and 23\% in the placebo group). Conclusions In patients with eosinophilic gastritis or duodenitis, AK002 reduced gastrointestinal eosinophils and symptoms. Infusion-related reactions were more common with AK002 than with placebo.

  abstract = {The nature of online social behaviour is largely changing, from communications taking place on open platforms to interactions occurring in hidden, group-based spaces or closed fora. Boccia Artieri (2017) has called this the new geography of unsearchable small conversations. This transformation challenges our current understanding and application of research ethics in qualitative digital sociology because, on one hand, we can no longer lean upon the approaches used by social data science to handle big and open data and, on the other, we cannot exclusively rely on established practices in qualitative sociology. Academic inquiry into these closed messaging threads and fora, however, remains of great societal importance, not least because of the rise of hate and extreme content in such spaces. With researchers now facing increased barriers when accessing social media (such as having to register an account, the inability to enter a group or chat without being invited, and so on), a rethinking of some of the long-standing cornerstones of ethical research is required for the digital age. The paper makes a methodological contribution to this field by delivering an assessment tool based on the methodology of the project Online Hateful Youth Sociality, which explores the use of memes to share hate on social media. The tool bridges the perspectives of digital sociology, criminology, and digital humanities with ethnographic real-world research to address the ethical issues of disclosure and intrusiveness, harm, the public or private nature of online spaces, and informed consent in the context of researching behaviour in small and hard-to-reach online groups. The assessment tool is presented in the form of an ethical decision flowchart that advocates for an approach that is not only situated but also structured. Ethical considerations are thus applied to the relevant issues depending on specific contexts but with clear, ``step-by-step'' assessment guidance.},

However, without a measure of how challenged players feel during the act of play, it is hard to design games that are neither too easy nor too hard and, therefore, truly enjoyable. Especially in industry, challenge is dominantly assessed by means of manual play testing in ad-hoc trials. The aim of this research is to create a more systematic, complete, and reliable instrument to evaluate the level of players' experienced challenge in games in the form of a questionnaire. This paper presents the key results from an extensive literature survey which will inform further development. We survey definitions of challenge, challenge types, and their relation to player experience based on the observations of game designers. We furthermore draw from empirical findings in a diverse range of fields such as game studies, human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI).},

However, it has not been considered how such imaginaries are activated when users interact with AI technologies. We present findings of a study on how users on a subreddit discussed `training' their Replika bot girlfriend. The discussions featured two discursive themes that focused on the AI imaginary of ideal technology and the gendered imaginary of the ideal bot girlfriend. Users expected their AI Replikas to both be customizable to serve their needs and to have a human-like or sassy mind of their own and not spit out machine-like answers. Users thus projected dominant notions of male control over technology and women, mixed with AI and postfeminist fantasies of ostensible independence onto the interactional agents and activated similar scripts embedded in the devices. The vicious feedback loop consolidated dominant scripts on gender and technology whilst appearing novel and created by users. While most research on the use of AI is conducted in applied computer science to improve user experience, this article outlines a media and cultural studies lens for a critical understanding of these emerging technologies as they become embedded in communication and meaning-making.},

Scientism is increasingly influential in popular scientific literature and intellectual life in general, but philosophers have hitherto largely ignored it. This collection is one of the first to develop and assess scientism as a serious philosophical position. It features twelve new essays by both proponents and critics of scientism. Before scientism can be evaluated, it needs to be clear what it is. Hence, the collection opens with essays that provide an overview of the many different versions of scientism and their mutual interrelations. Next, several card-carrying proponents of scientism make their case, either by developing and arguing directly for their preferred version of scientism or by responding to objections. Then, the floor is given to critics of scientism. It is examined whether scientism is epistemically vicious, whether scientism presents a plausible general epistemological outlook and whether science has limits. The final four essays zoom out and connect scientism to ongoing debates elsewhere in philosophy. What does scientism mean for religious epistemology? What can science tell us about morality and is a scientistic moral epistemology plausible? How is scientism related to physicalism? And is experimental philosophy really a form of scientism tailored to philosophy?"--},

  abstract = {Objective:~         The present study investigated the role of mental skills in surgery through the unique lens of current surgeons who had previously served as Olympic athletes, elite musicians, or expert military personnel.         Background:~         Recent work has demonstrated great potential for mental skills training in surgery. However, as a field, we lag far behind other high-performance domains that explicitly train and practice mental skills to promote optimal performance. Surgery stands to benefit from this work. First, there is a need to identify which mental skills might be most useful in surgery and how they might be best employed.         Methods:~         Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 surgeons across the United States and Canada who had previously performed at an elite level in sport, music, or the military.         Results:~         Mental skills were used both to optimize performance in the moment and longitudinally. In the moment, skills were used proactively to enter an ideal performance state, and responsively to address unwanted thoughts or emotions to re-enter an acceptable performance zone. Longitudinally, participants used skills to build expertise and maintain wellness.         Conclusions:~         Establishing a taxonomy for mental skills in surgery may help in the development of robust mental skills training programs to promote optimal surgeon wellness and performance.},

In response, this article reads scientometric data and game studies editorials, handbooks, and introductions through the lens of interdisciplinarity studies to assess game studies' status as an interdiscipline. It argues that game studies show drivers and hurdles typical for interdisciplines. Yet instead of establishing themselves as the broad umbrella interdiscipline of digital game research, they are becoming one narrow cultural studies multidiscipline within the growing and diversifying field of game research and education. Researchers from fields like human--computer interaction or communication are abandoning game studies venues in favor of disciplinary ones---ironically thanks to game studies legitimizing game research. This article suggests that a design orientation and cross-disciplinary boundary objects such as middle range theories could help to broaden, deepen, and secure future interdisciplinary game research.},

This occurs in interactive, video, audio, and textual media alike. Immersive game environments intensify this process, as James Gee states in 2003, but intrinsic learning has taken place in board games, and according to Mary Flanagan this dates back at least to 1250. On top of this, games are currently beginning to assert themselves as works of art. Considering game designers as artists raises the bar for creative responsibility. The goal of this article is to further an understanding of the role of the game designer as moral teacher and artist by studying an intersection of ethics and games. Our methodology for this study is to play through the ``Tranquility Lane'' quest in the video game Fallout 3 using Kant's theory and discuss creative choices in its design using the Categorical Imperative.},

Inductive framing analysis revealed that they highlight their excellence in six roles, which focus on appearance, relationships, activities, achievements, wisdom, and expertise. Additional multilevel analyses suggested that besides beauty, it is most important to be perceived as an exciting and experienced individual. These roles are generalizable across cultures, implying that the superwoman ideal is presented identically worldwide.},

While churches become tourist landmarks rather than places of worship; religions' stories and characters -- their intangible cultural heritage -- survive as rich bases for popular media alongside their traditional use of mediating divinity. This paper studies one form of such popular media -- Japanese videogames, using the Final Fantasy series as a case study -- to ask which religions, folklores, cultures and their divinities are represented in videogames? (All of them, flattened non-hierarchically.) How are these divinities mediated in videogames? (Together, juxtaposed eclectically.) And what are the implications for including what are normally mutually exclusive mediations of divine worship into popular media together? (It re-introduces them to a practice common outside of Abrahamic, protestant conceptions of world religion, by freely combining cultural heritages and religious practices in what are called `multiple religious belongings'). While these representations of eclectic religion may seem to trivialise traditions by making them interchangeable, it also manages to de-objectivate them and reveal their fictional, artefactual origin as cultural heritage, while leaving them intact as contemporary practices.},

Who decides to put religion into those games? How? And why? To find out, we interviewed 22 developers on the Assassin's Creed franchise, including directors and writers. Based on those, we show that the ``who'' of Ubisoft is not a person but an industry: a de-personalized and codified process. How? Marketing, editorial and production teams curb creative teams into reproducing a formula: a depoliticized, universalized, and science-fictionalized ``marketable religion.'' Why? Because this marketable form of religious heritage can be consumed by everyone---regardless of cultural background or conviction. As such, this paper adds an empirically grounded perspective on the ``who,'' ``why,'' and ``how'' of cultural industries' successful commodification of religious and cultural heritage.},

Building on studies emphasizing that such accounts are one-sided at best, and pars pro toto stigmatizations at worst; we propose to study what we call `` participatory conspiracy culture''---the everyday, mundane online debates about conspiracy theories. Based on a 6-month ethnography on Reddit's r/conspiracy subreddit, an analysis of 242 selected discussions, and supported by digital methods tool 4CAT, this article addresses the question of how people participate in online conspiracy culture. It shows that among the plethora of conspiracy theories discussed online, discussions are heterogeneous, and their participants relate to each other primarily through conflict. Three epistemological positions occur: belief (particularly leading to constant discreditation of others' beliefs), doubt (particularly as opposed to belief), and play (particularly with the fun of entertaining conspiracy theories without taking them too seriously). We conclude that the participatory conspiracy culture of r/conspiracy is not a homogenous echo chamber of radical belief, but a heterogeneous participatory culture in which belief is fundamentally contested, rather than embraced.},

  abstract = {Young people in the West are more likely to encounter religion in videogames than in places of worship like churches, mosques or temples. This dissertation departs from observations by enthusiastic theologians who find religion everywhere in videogames -- the largest cultural industry in the world. However, if religions are beliefs in supernatural substances given meaning to, culturally, through objects and social functions; then what is really religious about games? Playing at Religion takes an encoding/decoding approach to the appearance of religion in games by asking: ``So what?'' In other words, ``What does the appearance of religion in games actually mean to the people making and playing them?'' Chapter 1 reviews the literature on secularization, leading to the question of how religion's mediatization changes it, and for whom. Chapter 2 contains notes on methodology. Divided into three parts, the empirical chapters concern developers, games, and players respectively. Part I on Encoding opens with Chapter 3, arguing on the basis of ethnography and 22 interviews with developers of Assassin's Creed that commercial interests drive a corporation to create a nostalgic `Marketable Religion' that commodifies belief by reducing it to an acceptable version for the largest possible audience. Chapter 4 argues on the basis of 35 interviews with independent developers that, despite the promise of their independence, religious and irreligious `indies' alike similarly cannot escape a standardized, inherited conventions of religion in game design that are divorced from their own beliefs, and are as commodified as they are Eurocentric in the resulting use of religion in game design. Part II on the Games themselves contains Chapters 5 and 6: two content analyses of two genres -- fantasy and the post-apocalypse -- that show the extent of how games historicize and combine religious cultural heritages into `Eclectic Religion' or even apply it in new ways, by using divine metaphors to deify `Awe-ful Technologies' such as AI and the atom bomb. Part III on Decoding opens with Chapter 7, analyzing on the basis of 100 online forum discussions how games prompt players to discuss the meanings and meaninglessness of religion in videogames among themselves in a `Pop Theology,' based on their personal religious beliefs. Chapter 8 further analyses the experiences of 20 such interviewed players to understand how `Playing the Other' in videogames enables them to try on and drop others' religious beliefs and identities as they wish. The dissertation concludes that developers, games and players engage in a playing `at' religion which reduces religions as sources of ultimate meaning to commodified, mediatized simulacra which allow for a `ludic epistemology.' In doing so, games inspire us to play at religion like children play soldier or house: a rethinking of religious worldviews as no longer a question of belief or disbelief in ultimate truths; but as something to be tried on, compared and discarded. Thus mediatized, millions of players globally have all the possible beliefs in the world available to them, playing at religion with the push of a button.},

The term has roots in the religious tradition of the Indian subcontinent and was subsequently imported into video game terminology during a period of widespread appropriation of Eastern culture by Californian tech industries. We argue that the use of the term was not a case of happenstance but a signaling of the potential for computing to offer a mystical or enchanted perspective within an otherwise secular world. This suggests that the concept is useful in game cultures precisely because it plays with the ``otherness'' of the term's original meaning. We argue that this indicates a fundamental hybridity to gaming cultures that highlight the need to add postcolonial perspectives to how issues of diversity and power in gaming cultures are understood.},

Community managers do not fully represent the interests of one group, and their intermediary role puts particular stresses on the types of emotional labor that they are called upon to enact. Further, community managers must also participate in social labor---work that builds and exploits social connections for monetary gain. Most of this labor, however, is undervalued and in some instances is simply uncompensated "free" labor carried out by members of a fan community. Ultimately, we argue, casting the role of the community manager as a social and emotional laborer feminizes this work, monetarily devaluing it while isolating workers in these roles from the communities that they ostensibly serve.},

  abstract = {There is increasing concern and consternation about generative artificial intelligence (AI) programs and its potential impact on academia. This editorial addresses the potential impact of such programs on scientific publishing as it relates to the journal Biological Psychology. Using chatGPT as an example, it makes the case that a prime concern is its implications for facilitating plagiarism. It briefly outlines what is known about the algorithm of the GPT text model, and also the implications of its chatGPT front end, on being able to establish appropriate credit for ideas in text that it outputs. It is concluded that, at least for Biological Psychology, the expectation is that authors will be transparent about AI usage, will declare when AI is the source of an idea, and will redouble efforts to seek out and cite prior claims to ideas in the published literature when AI is involved.},

  abstract = {Video games are an enormous segment of popular media today, comparable to television and movies. Moreover, video games represent a new form of media distinguished from previous forms due to the interactive element, where game players have the ability to change and influence the game world. This paper contributes to the study of race and popular media by examining how race is presented in role-playing video games through the feature of avatar creation. Capabilities for avatar creation are analyzed in over sixty massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) in service as of early 2010 and twenty offline role-playing games (RPGs) published over the past 10 years. The analysis shows that the vast majority of games, both online and offline, do not allow for the creation of avatars with a non-white racial appearance. Forcing an Anglo appearance on avatars that purport to represent the player has the potential to reinforce a sense of normative whiteness as well as shape the social composition of online worlds into all-white virtual spaces, contributing to the creation of a virtual ``white habitus.''},

Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARS-CoV-2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways. We believe this information is useful to corporate and public administrators and individuals responsible for building operations and environmental services in their decision-making process about the degree and duration of social-distancing measures during viral epidemics and pandemics.},

  abstract = {H. P. Lovecraft's iconic Cosmic Horror tales frequently involve an encounter with a non-human incommensurability that strains human systems of representation. However, while current critical work often focuses on the materialistic disruption caused by such contact, there has been little focus on the objects within these stories. I argue that the representation of such items reflects upon the paradigms through which material worth is perceived and can consequently assist in further nuancing theoretical critiques of anthropocentric epistemology. Video games frequently place material assets to construct a certain frame of contact for the player. It is within Lovecraftian video game adaptations then that there lies the potential to re-conceptualise the study of object encounter and representation to reflect upon the urgency of challenging processes of non-human contact. This article explores the role of artefacts within Lovecraft's fiction, the representation of materiality in a range of video game adaptations, and finally examines the process of ``narrative archaeology'' in Bloodborne, where the player must piece together micro narratives from textual descriptions to reveal the macro cosmic revelation. In so doing, I argue that Bloodborne helps to identify the critical potential of Lovecraftian adaptation for materialist critique through the framework of virtual encounters.},

  abstract = {This study shows how cyberautoethnography can be used to critically interrogate and make sense of how technology and attendant artifacts shape our understanding of embodiment. Specifically, this goal is achieved by applying cyberautoethnography to study Bitmoji avatars, a digital artifact, as a type of digital embodiment. Users can personalize Bitmoji avatars by choosing from a variety of skin tones, body sizes, and other physical characteristics. Thus, similar to the creation of other avatars (such as those in social media and gaming environments), creating and circulating these digital artifacts can be understood as acts of strategic digital (re)presentation and embodiment. Here, I reflect on the process of creating my Bitmoji avatar and analyze conversations using Bitmojis to discuss how I use my Bitmoji to make my body hypervisible in a context that's typically understood as disembodied. I conclude that the seemingly mundane use of Bitmojis can be understood as a feminist practice that marginalized individuals might engage with in order to extend the political dimensions of everyday, lived experiences into the digital realm. Thus, this critical cyberautoethnography showcases the value of autoethnography for understanding how agency is claimed and limited by contemporary forms of technology-mediated embodiment.},

  abstract = {Narrative game designer, or simply narrative designer, is a role in contemporary computer game development. The narrative designer is responsible for designing the player's experience of a game's fictional world. This study delves into the practice of narrative design from the perspective of embodied presence. In comparison with books, movies and other media, the medium of computer games excels in offering the media user the feeling of being a physically present participant in the fictional world. When exploiting the merits of embodied presence, narrative designers are challenged to express fictional worlds without disrupting this feeling of ``being-there''. Close-ups, flashbacks, ellipses and other narrative devices--common to other audio-visual media--cannot be employed to the same extent. This study reconceptualises and apposes the notions of presence and narrative by critically expanding on Presence Theory, phenomenological media theory and narratology. Drawing from insights and practices in game, film, performance, architecture and literature studies, the study subsequently proposes alternative narrative devices, more compatible with the interactive and spatial nature of computer games, enabling designers to express fictional worlds while maintaining the player's feeling of embodied presence.},

Raechel Dumas examines the role of female monsters in selected works of fiction, manga, film, and video games, offering a trans-genre, trans-media analysis of this enduring trope. The book focuses on several iterations of the monstrous-feminine in contemporary Japan: the self-replicating sh\=ojo in horror, monstrous mothers in science fiction, female ghosts and suburban hauntings in cinema, female monsters and public violence in survival horror games, and the rebellious female body in mytho-fiction. Situating the titles examined here amid discourses of crisis that have materialized in contemporary Japan, Dumas illuminates the ambivalent pleasure of the monstrous-feminine as a trope that both articulates anxieties centered on shifting configurations of subjectivity and nationhood, and elaborates novel possibilities for identity negotiation and social formation in a period marked by dramatic change},

  abstract = {With the advent of new technologies expectations of new gender relations and (de)constructions also came. How is gender constructed in the age of the cyborgism? Do old gender traits and hierarchies prevail or do the fluid ether and augmentations of body parts allow for a move toward transgenderism or postgenderism? In fact, can we and should we move beyond gender? With the occurrence of phenomena such as gender swapping, virtual sex, virtual stalking and virtual rape online, gender as a construction, is still high on the electronic agenda. As Theresa Senft explains ``You may not believe in gender, but gender believes in you''. This article will focus on the gender construction of selected virtual game characters, by implementing an archetypal psychological approach. The ``virtual babes'' that will be discussed are Lara Croft of Tomb Raiders, Elexis Sinclaire of Sin and All New Gen(der) from the Bad Code game. These virtual characters will provide interesting visual clues about the state of gender identity online. Without simplifying or predicting, most of these virtual characters are still handicapped by problematic fin de millennium femme fatale traits, whereas only a few playfully deconstructs traditional gender identities. Furthermore, the fact that most of these ``virtual babes'' are mainly created and absorbed at this stage by an adolescent male audience, contribute greatly to their specific gender characteristics. In fact, it seems as if the promise of experimental and interesting gender relations are not always realised and that the greatest part of virtual female characters are still portrayed with the same gender prejudices intact. It's gender as usual for most ``virtual babes''.},

  abstract = {Reply to Morozov's 'Critique of Techno-Feudal Reason' E vgeny morozov has provided a salutary critique of recent proposals to conceptualize the social relations of the digital economy-with web users supposedly tied like serfs to tech barons' inescapable domains-by analogy with those of the feudal era. His 'Critique of Techno-Feudal Reason' offers a systematic review of contemporary feudal-speak as a discursive swamp in which, he charges, 'the left has a hard time differentiating itself from the right'-neoliberals like Glen Weyl and Eric Posner, as well as neoreactionaries like Curtis Yarvin and anti-wokite Joel Kotkin, articulating the same 'neo-' or 'techno-feudal' critique as Yanis Varoufakis, Mariana Mazzucato, Robert Kuttner or Jodi Dean. If radical thinkers have embraced feudal imagery as a rhetorical, meme-friendly ploy, Morozov argues that this is testament not to media savviness but to intellectual weakness-'as if the left's theoretical framework can no longer make sense of capitalism without mobilizing the moral language of corruption and perversion.' By shifting its attention from actual capitalist relations to reminiscences of feudalism, it risks letting go its prey to chase a shadow, abandoning its most original and effective angle of attack on exploitative socioeconomic relations-its sophisticated anti-capitalist political-theoretical apparatus. 1 In defining his terms-what makes 'capitalism' capitalism and 'feudalism' feudalism-Morozov reaches back to 1970s debates, in particular Robert Brenner's critique of Immanuel Wallerstein's The Origins of the Modern World System (1974). 2 In Morozov's view, Brenner's distinction},

  abstract = {This article considers several instances of biblical reception in the science-fiction role-playing game Horizon Zero Dawn (Guerrilla Games/Sony, 2017). The game's characterisation of technology, science, and religion has led some commentators to understand Horizon Zero Dawn as presenting a firm rejection of religious narratives in favour of scientific perspectives. However, closer examination of the game's biblical influences reveals that Horizon Zero Dawn employs religious ideas of the past and present to articulate its vision of a post apocalyptic future. The integration of biblical material into the story, aesthetics, and gameplay of Horizon Zero Dawn provides multi-layered interactions with specific characters, images, and ideas from the Bible. The game engages with the narrative of David and Goliath, the plague imagery of the Exodus narrative, and New Testament apocalyptic imagery in order to tell a story of ecological collapse, global apocalypse, and technological re- creation. Investigation of its biblical influences demonstrates that Horizon Zero Dawn embraces religious narratives insofar as they may be integrated into the game's discussion of human responsibility, environmental sustainability, and the existential concerns of its post-apocalyptic scenario.},

These are characters such as wizards, who in fantasy are often elevated from the position of secondary characters they held in fairy tales to the stories' protagonists. This makes fantasy works a good vessel for a discussion of the problems of otherness. As the genre evolves, the presentation of the Other becomes more complex. In modern works they are often portrayed as the Other on multiple levels. As readers have become more accustomed to Tolkienian wizards, dwarves, or rangers set apart from human society, the protagonists of modern fantasy stories are often made the Other to their own in-groups. The article presents a number of such characters from selected modern Polish fantasy novels and short story cycles.},

We posit (a) that shared reality involves a (subjectively perceived) commonality of individuals' inner states (not just observable behaviors); (b) that shared reality is about some target referent; (c) that for a shared reality to occur, the commonality of inner states must be appropriately motivated; and (d) that shared reality involves the experience of a successful connection to other people's inner states. In reviewing relevant evidence, we emphasize research on the saying-is-believing effect, which illustrates the creation of shared reality in interpersonal communication. We discuss why shared reality provides a better explanation of the findings from saying-is-believing studies than do other formulations. Finally, we examine relations between our conceptualization of shared reality and related constructs (including empathy, perspective taking, theory of mind, common ground, embodied synchrony, and socially distributed knowledge) and indicate how our approach may promote a comprehensive and differentiated understanding of social-sharing phenomena.},

The sources are considered in particular detail, and the additions and deletions which Malory makes to them: central to the investigation is the ways in which the fifteenth-century work on the one hand conserves thirteenth-century narratives such as Le Mort le Roi Artu, yet on the other reconstitutes it as something new, an approach which differs from the current critical trend of considering the Morte mainly in relation to its contemporary milieu. In so doing, the author develops a theory of `symbolic structure' to account for the principles of generation and combination of narrative elements in Malory, looking at the ways in which entire narratives can be put into motion by the power of a symbol such as Balin's sword, or the grail itself.},

A unified analysis of this phenomenon has important consequences for understanding emergent relationships between individual agency, platform structure, and online culture. The sociotechnical practices of leaving resulting from the 2018 Tumblr adult content ban link up to fundamental questions around movement, selfhood, and power. We discuss non-use as an overlapping and interacting set of social decisions largely (and perhaps unsurprisingly) disincentivized by the technical affordances of the platform, as well as migration as a shifting and reconfiguring of platform specific social relations. Placing classic questions of social theory in conversation with scholarship on platform socialities, we explore the 2018 Tumblr purge/migration to elucidate the polyvalent technical and social actions involved in `leaving'.},

Furthermore, we delve into the potential fusion between independent games and cultural heritage by presenting several paradigms and posing pertinent questions about this evolution. Our study offers a framework that envisions games with strong local identities from diverse regions forming transnational networks and agencies within the videogame industry.

  abstract = {The Legend of Zelda series is one of the most popular and recognizable examples in videogames of what Tolkien referred to as mythopoeia, or myth-making. In his essay On Fairy Stories and a short poem entitled Mythopoeia, Tolkien makes the case that the fairy tale aesthetic is simply a more intimate version of the same principle underlying the great myths: the human desire to make meaning out of the world. By using mythopoeia as a touchstone concept, the essays in this volume explore how The Legend of Zelda series turns the avatar, through which the player interacts with the in-game world, into a player-character symbiote wherein the individual both enacts and observes the process of integrating worldbuilding with storytelling. Twelve essays explore Zelda's mythmaking from the standpoints of literary criticism, videogame theory, musicology, ecocriticism, pedagogy, and more.},

His comments, however, were welcomed by Al-Qaeda, who had long been describing Western powers in precisely the same terms, as modern Crusaders once again invading the Middle East. Ten years later in 2011, Anders Behring Breivik launched a tragic attack in Norway, killing 77 unarmed civilians, mostly teenagers. Breivik saw himself as a Templar Knight, a member of a group of knights allegedly resurrected in London in 2002 by one "Lionheart". Later investigations suggested that the blogger, Lionheart, might have had links to the right-wing, anti-Muslim, English Defence League and other so-called "counterjihad" blogging networks decrying an Islamic invasion of Europe. Though extreme examples, these cases all share a crucial detail: the framing of current political issues in terms of recognisable medieval precedents. In the widespread use of medievalism across social- and mass-media channels, it is clear that such political medievalisms are not intended as a specific reference to a historical precedent, but as a use of the past for modern concerns. The argument of this book is that we need new ways of analysing this kind of medievalism; extending far beyond the concept of anachronism or inaccuracy, references to Crusades, Templars and Vikings affect the way we understand our world ...

This article marries close analysis of the video game Undertale with theories of parasocial phenomena to examine how effective parasocial relationships (PSRs) are created with its cast of quirky, loveable monsters. The article uses players' reception of the game in the form of Steam reviews and Let's play content to evidence players' attachments to NPCs and uses the concept of parasociality coupled with close reading to explore why. The paper concludes by considering what insights analysis of PSRs in video games can provide regarding both our relationships with the technology that facilitates them, and our off-screen relationships.},

Participants low in previous exposure to video game violence who played a violent (relative to a nonviolent) game showed a reduction in the P3 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) to violent images (indicating physiological desensitization), and this brain response mediated the effect of video game content on subsequent aggressive behavior. These data provide the first experimental evidence linking violence desensitization with increased aggression, and show that a neural marker of this process can at least partially account for the causal link between violent game exposure and aggression.},

  abstract = {Most ecological experiments are performed on spatial and temporal scales that are much smaller and shorter than the systems and time frames of interest. Available data, however, suggest that experimental results often change with the size of the experimental arena and the duration of the experiment (i.e. are scale-dependent). As a consequence, the interpretation of experimental results often requires extrapolation from the limited spatial and temporal scales of experimental systems to the much larger and longer scales of natural systems. In this paper we discuss the implications of scale-dependence, particularly spatial scale-dependence, for the design and interpretation of experiments. We suggest that the problem of extrapolation across scales should be avoided when possible, either by matching the physical size of experimental units with the size of the system of interest or by designing small-scale experimental systems so that the processes of interest are given a realistic representation. When this is not possible it becomes necessary to translate experimental results to other scales, which requires that the mechanisms that generate scale-dependence are understood and that they can be incorporated into models that make predictions for other scales. We review and classify sources of scale-dependence in ecological responses to perturbations and describe attempts to incorporate these mechanisms into scaling models. Among the mechanisms we describe are exchange processes, nonlinear averaging in heterogeneous systems, and arena artifacts. At present, we do not know if available scaling models can make accurate quantitative extrapolations from experimental to natural scales. Thus, the primary, current value of scale models is the identification of scale ranges with particularly weak or strong scale-dependence.},

It focuses on key questions for literary scholars and teachers: How can literature be taught in such a way as to make it relevant for an increasingly hypermedia-oriented readership? How can the rapidly evolving new media be integrated into curricula that still seek to transmit 'traditional' literary competence?  How can the notion of literary competence be broadened to take into account these current trends?  This study, which argues for hypertext's integration in the literary canon, offers a critical overview of developments in hypertext theory, an exemplary hypertext canon and an evaluation of possible classroom applications.},

The contributors' disciplinary backgrounds include media, communication, cultural and literary studies, and they examine issues of reception and production, identity, community, gender, spatiality, natural and built environments using a plethora of methodological approaches ranging from theoretical and philosophical contemplation through social semiotics to corpus-based discourse analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that ``modernity'', as a process, a temporality, a category, and so on, is akin to Orientalism in that those who speak of it produce it as their ideology, their stereotyping of themselves and their others. The first section, on time, employs Kristeva's work in ``Women's Time'' in regards to the gendered politics of chaos and ordering. The second section, on alterity, pulls from various ``times'' and ``spaces'', where multiple authors from, at times, conflicting backgrounds converge on the politics of othering. The third section, on consent, is on structuring the limits of imaginable alternatives of discourse. The final section draws from the previous three in order to deconstruct ``modernity'' as a mythology of temporal, spacial and societal orderliness, producing forms of alterity to manufacture the consent of whomever speaks of modernity towards creating a convenient history and setting a hegemony-laden agenda. As such, modernity takes the place of ``the real'' to consolidate and augment hegemony by way of self-naturalization. It is a manufactured consent, of those who speak of, to and about it, to colonial aggression and arrogance by evacuating colonial relations of power from the limits of the debate.},

  abstract = {There is a continued fascination with all things monster. This is partly due to the popular reception of Mary Shelley's Monster, termed a `new species' by its overreaching but admiringly determined maker Victor Frankenstein in the eponymous novel first published in 1818. The enduring impact of Shelley's novel, which spans a plethora of subjects and genres in imagery and themes, raises questions of origin and identity, death, birth and family relationships, as well as the contradictory qualities of the monster. Monsters serve as metaphors for anxieties of aberration and innovation (Punter and Byron, 2004). Stephen Asma (2009) notes that monsters represent evil or moral transgression and each epoch, to speak with Michel Foucault (Abnormal: lectures at the Coll\`ege de France, 1975--75, 2003, p. 66), evidences a `particular type of monster'. Academic debates tend to explore how social and cultural threats come to be embodied in the figure of a monster and their actions literalise our deepest fears (Gilmore, 2009; Scott, 2007). Monsters in contemporary culture, however, have become more humane than ever before. Monsters are strong, resilient, creative and sly creatures. Through their playful and invigorating energy they can be seen to disrupt and unsettle. They still cater to the appetite for horror, but they also encourage us to feel empathy. The encounter with a monster can enable us to stop, wonder and change our attitudes towards technology, our body and each other. This commentary article considers the use of the concepts of `monsters' or `monstrosity' in literature, contemporary research, culture and teaching contexts at the intersection of the Humanities and the Social Sciences.},

Based on the Uses and Gratifications Theory and the concept of the Need to Belong, we postulate that an individual's Perceived Belonging (i.e., the degree to which a person feels connected to and accepted by others) positively influences his/her Actual Game Use, i.e., how often he/she plays Pok\'emon. After surveying 2,294 German-speaking visitors of one of Germany's most popular Pok\'emon websites and applying a structural equation modeling approach, we confirmed that Perceived Belonging is a direct positive influence factor of Actual Game Use as well as an indirect factor through Perceived Enjoyment. Overall, our study suggests that developers should include belonging-oriented aspects into their games, such as virtual pets, to increase individuals' video game usage through their Perceived Belonging.},

Readers and students thus acquire a global perspective on the central ethical issues of digital media, including privacy, copyright, pornography and violence, and the ethics of cross-cultural communication online. The book is designed for use across disciplines -- media and communication studies, computer science and informatics, as well as philosophy. It is up-to-date, accessible and student- and classroom-friendly: each topic and theory is interwoven throughout the volume with detailed sets of questions that foster careful reflection, writing, and discussion into these issues and their possible resolutions.

At opposite ends of the video game production scale, they evince cultural identity in very different ways. Through analysis of company press releases, trade press and close reading, these distinct mediated constructions of cultural identity reveal how gestures toward diversity in Overwatch demand legibility and subjection to terms set by a Global North-centric perspective, while the Somewhere series expresses specific histories and cultural traditions that refuse legibility to a larger image economy. The author evaluates both games through Souvik Mukherjee's model of postcolonial video game criticism, Herman Gray's theories of subjection and opacity, and Alexander Galloway's realist notion of fidelities of context. When viewed through these theoretical lenses the character design choices in Overwatch belie a single-tier, postcolonial, transparent fidelity of context. Conversely, the work of Oleomingus offers an opaque fidelity of context built as a two-tier construction of postcolonial play. As a pair, they represent the limits of representation afforded to mass-market video game production methods, as well as the political efficacy afforded to small-scale game producers working with opacity. Additionally, the comparison directs attention to the video game production of the Global South as a critical area for reevaluating current assumptions and conventions of playable media.},

As is well known, Kuklick insists that symbolic/semiotic methodologies cannot substitute for material, quantifiable research of 'America' in all its complexity. His is an empiricist's plea against symbolic signification. Kuklick's critique quietly prevails today, in an age when comparative sociological and ethnographic approaches to the study of American society and culture enjoy a conspicuous, if not uncontested, ascendance, at least in the United States. Within the context of the globalization of American Studies and current post-national approaches in the field, this essay argues that the worldwide images that 'America' projects, and the icons by which it is widely identified, retain not only the legitimacy of methodology, but suggest as well their necessity as a cross-cultural epistemology. On the one hand, language barriers alone recommend symbolic, iconographie study as a practical means of knowledge production and apprehension in lieu of an alternative common critical idiom. On the other hand, a resurgent European interest in 'America' as symbol suggests a tacit defense among international members of a growing American Studies community of symbolic figuration itself as a means of cultural comprehension.]},

Among this confrontational sisterhood, you'll find the Dyke Manifesto by the Lesbian Avengers, The Ax Tampax Poem Feministo by the Bloodsisters Project, the Manifesto of Apocalyptic Witchcraft by Peter Grey, Simone de Beauvoir's pro-abortion Manifesto of the 343, Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female by Frances M. Beal, The Futurist Manifesto of Lust by Valentine de Saint-Point, the Riot Grrrl Manifesto by Bikini Kill, and many more. Feminist academic and writer Breanne Fahs argues that we need manifestos in all their urgent rawness-their insistence that we have to act now, that we must face this, and that the bleeding edge of rage and defiance is where new ideas are born"--},

We use data-driven modeling that distils genres from textual descriptions of a large collection of games. We analyze the evolution of game genres from 1979 till 2010. Our results indicate that until 1990, there have been many genres competing for dominance, but thereafter sport-racing, strategy, and action have become the most prevalent genres. Moreover, we find that games vary to a great extent as to whether they belong mostly to one genre or to a combination of several genres. We also compare the results of our data-driven model with two product databases, Metacritic and Mobygames, and observe that the classifications of games to different genres are substantially different, even between product databases. We conclude with discussion on potential future applications and how they may further our understanding of video game genres.},

This essay adds to the growing body of literature on Horizon by considering its representations of not just people, but media forms and our relationships with them. To this end, I situate Horizon within the broader context of `meta-games,' that is, games that comment on their own forms, histories, and place in culture writ large. Over the past decade, there has been a proliferation of such `games about games,' including The Stanley Parable (Galactic Cafe, 2013), Getting Over It (Foddy, 2017), and Undertale (Fox, 2015) to name just a few. These works expect and demand a different kind of cultural literacy than metagaming as practice, which usually refers to a player's familiarity with game mechanics, design, interface, and successful play strategies. Stephanie Boluk and Patricia Lemieux have recently observed that metagaming is an approach ``in which playing, making, and thinking about games occur in the same act'' and which are defined by the material discontinuities that emerge between the experience of playing video games and their nonhuman operations (8-9). While one could consider how players' familiarity with game conventions shapes how they experience Horizon as an amalgam of Triple-A game mechanics, I am more interested in the ways in which its content pushes the player to think about games as cultural objects. Horizon is less a game about games than a game about media. Like much twenty-first century science fiction, it inherits Cyberpunk's anxieties about humans' simultaneous enhancement and corruption by technology and the loss of individual autonomy, and finds utopian possibilities by recasting agency as collective and embodied (Flanagan 1-5). As a work that is self-aware of its material and cultural realities, Horizon combines its subject matter with media-specific effects such as player identification and the human-computer interface to examine the material costs of new media objects and their inextricability from ourselves and our environment.},

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the ways in which video games are engaged in ecocriticism as an aspect of cultural work invested in the future. In the presented reading of the 2017 video game Horizon: Zero Dawn, it is argued that the combination of the affect creating process of play, in combination with a posthumanist and postnatural plot, creates an experience of futurity, which challenges generic notions of linear temporal progress and of the conventional telos of dystopian fiction in a digital medium. The experience of the narrative video game Horizon Zero Dawn is presented as an example of an aesthetic experience that affords futurity as an effect of playing, interlinked with a reflection on the shape of the future in a posthumanist narrative.},

By sending players on the journey of a hero to restore order in a polluted but majestic world, the game evokes a bewildering variety of affects in them. These oscillate between positive and negative ones---such as curiosity and fear, excitement and distress, startle and anger, pleasure and terror---and are outlined by the game's structural peculiarities (its implied player) in different ways, depending on the region of the gameworld. The players' affective responses then culminate in the tumultuous emotion of astonishment and in the aesthetic response of the sublime. The experience of play---in the interaction between (eco)game, player, and world (culture)---is thus a regenerative one on an affective and subsequent aesthetic level. It resensitises players to the beauty of the natural world, while granting them a different point of view on ecosystems and ecological issues that plague their contemporary surroundings.},

By using mythopoeia as a touchstone concept, the essays in this volume explore how The Legend of Zelda series turns the avatar, through which the player interacts with the in-game world, into a player-character symbiote wherein the individual both enacts and observes the process of integrating worldbuilding with storytelling. Twelve essays explore Zelda's mythmaking from the standpoints of literary criticism, videogame theory, musicology, ecocriticism, pedagogy, and more.},

The auditive component and its increasingly important role are analyzed in connection with the graphic design of games, virtual reality, as well as the popularity of specific games. This paper also focuses on audio-games, the use of binaural sound (which was first used ona large scale in Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice) and various hybrid digital games, which are balancing between classic games and audio-games. Argumentation is based on an assumption that binaural sound is the way to ambisonic sound, which (within the context of the immersive and interactive character of digital games) predestines the new standard and shows an entirely new way of creating and using digital games at the same time. All of this is reflected in the context of the graphic design of digital games and their future.},

We hypothesized that interactive gameplay would positively predict transportation into the story world. Then, transportation would predict identification with the main character. This identification should then reduce stigma in two ways: by lowering stereotyping and limiting participants' desire for social distance. A two-factor, yoked experiment was designed utilizing Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, a game praised for its accurate portrayal of psychosis. The main character, Senua, suffers from psychosis and must navigate her quest along with her own mental health. Players either played the first 45 min of the game or watched gameplay footage of other participants' sessions. Transportation into the story world, identification with Senua, and the two aspects of stigma -- stereotyping and social distance -- were measured. Consistent with hypotheses, a structural equation model found an indirect path from gameplay to reduced social distance through first transportation and then identification. Players also reported higher levels of transportation than non-players, and that heightened transportation led to greater identification and then a lowered desire for social distance from the mentally ill. The indirect path to stereotyping was not significant. These results and implications are discussed in detail.},

To answer questions about harm to minors, these studies are arguably not very illuminating. In the current analysis, I sought to address this gap by focusing on studies of video game influences on child and adolescent samples. The effects of overall video game use and exposure to violent video games specifically were considered, although this was not an analysis of pathological game use. Overall, results from 101 studies suggest that video game influences on increased aggression (r = .06), reduced prosocial behavior (r = .04), reduced academic performance (r = -.01), depressive symptoms (r = .04), and attention deficit symptoms (r = .03) are minimal. Issues related to researchers' degrees of freedom and citation bias also continue to be common problems for the field. Publication bias remains a problem for studies of aggression. Recommendations are given on how research may be improved and how the psychological community should address video games from a public health perspective.},

Results indicated that publication bias does exist for experimental studies of aggressive behavior, as well as for non-experimental studies of aggressive behavior and aggressive thoughts. Research in other areas, including prosocial behavior and experimental studies of aggressive thoughts were less susceptible to publication bias.

Scholars too have been calling for higher quality research on this issue. The current study seeks to answer this call by providing longitudinal data on youth aggression and dating violence as potential consequences of violent video game exposure using well-validated clinical outcome measures and controlling for other relevant predictors of youth aggression. Method A sample of 165, mainly Hispanic youth, were tested at 3 intervals, an initial interview, and 1-year and 3-year intervals. Results Results indicated that exposure to video game violence was not related to any of the negative outcomes. Depression, antisocial personality traits, exposure to family violence and peer influences were the best predictors of aggression-related outcomes. Interpretation The current study supports a growing body of evidence pointing away from video game violence use as a predictor of youth aggression. Public policy efforts, including funding, would best be served by redirecting them toward other prevention programs for youth violence.},

Several recent meta-analyses, examining outcome measures most closely related to serious aggressive acts, found little evidence for a relationship between violent video games and aggression or violence. In a new meta-analysis, C. A. Anderson et al. (2010) questioned these findings. However, their analysis has several methodological issues that limit the interpretability of their results. In their analysis, C. A. Anderson et al. included many studies that do not relate well to serious aggression, an apparently biased sample of unpublished studies, and a ``best practices'' analysis that appears unreliable and does not consider the impact of unstandardized aggression measures on the inflation of effect size estimates. They also focused on bivariate correlations rather than better controlled estimates of effects. Despite a number of methodological flaws that all appear likely to inflate effect size estimates, the final estimate of r = .15 is still indicative of only weak effects. Contrasts between the claims of C. A. Anderson et al. (2010) and real-world data on youth violence are discussed.},

Given ongoing debates on video game influences, comments varied from the supportive to the self-proclaimed ``angry,'' yet hopefully they and this response will contribute to constructive discussion as the field moves forward. In this reply, I address some misconceptions in the comments and present data that challenge the assumption that standardized regression coefficients are invariably unsuitable for meta-analysis or that bivariate correlations are invariably suitable for meta-analysis. The suitability of any data should be considered on a case-by-case basis, and data indicates that the coefficients included in the ``Angry Birds'' meta-analysis did not distort results. Study selection, effect size extraction, and interpretation improved upon problematic issues in other recent meta-analyses. Further evidence is also provided to support the contention that publication bias remains problematic in video game literature. Sources of acrimony among scholars are explored as are areas of agreement. Ultimately, debates will only be resolved through a commitment to newer, more rigorous methods and open science.},

Effect sizes were adjusted for observed publication bias. Results Publication bias was a problem for studies of aggressive behavior, and methodological problems such as the use of poor aggression measures inflated effect size.

The current study builds upon previous research in a sample of 302 (52.3\% female) mostly Hispanic youth. Results indicated that current levels of depressive symptoms were a strong predictor of serious aggression and violence across most outcome measures. Depressive symptoms also interacted with antisocial traits so that antisocial individuals with depressive symptoms were most inclined toward youth violence.

The Supreme Court also referred to psychological research on violent video games as ``unpersuasive'' and noted that such research contains many methodological flaws. Recent reviews in many scholarly journals have come to similar conclusions, although much debate continues. Given past statements by the American Psychological Association linking video game and media violence with aggression, the Supreme Court ruling, particularly its critique of the science, is likely to be shocking and disappointing to some psychologists. One possible outcome is that the psychological community may increase the conclusiveness of their statements linking violent games to harm as a form of defensive reaction. However, in this article the author argues that the psychological community would be better served by reflecting on this research and considering whether the scientific process failed by permitting and even encouraging statements about video game violence that exceeded the data or ignored conflicting data. Although it is likely that debates on this issue will continue, a move toward caution and conservatism as well as increased dialogue between scholars on opposing sides of this debate will be necessary to restore scientific credibility. The current article reviews the involvement of the psychological science community in the Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association case and suggests that it might learn from some of the errors in this case for the future.},

Amid the multiple relevant figures in Game of Thrones, this article takes Arya Stark as the object of study to discuss questions of representation and gender in contemporary TV. Our method comprises the close reading of Arya's narrative arc and our main unit of analysis is the gender variable, placed in an intersectional frame. We argue that Arya fits the nuclear structure of the monomyth, but also that she challenges its constrictions, pushes its limits and rewrites some of its elements to create a post-gender version of the Campbellian adventure. Through a succession of extremely intense experiences, Arya is the character that most painstakingly earns and most adamantly vindicates her self-constructed identity in Game of Thrones. Hers, we contend, is a feminist journey that has broken moulds in audio-visual narrative and left a deep trace in the history of contemporary television. \copyright{} 2022 Intellect Ltd Article.},

This paper examines the different devices that videogames have used to incorporate stories through spatial design and what is known as environmental storytelling, focusing on the design elements that make the story directly relevant to gameplay beyond world-building and backstory exposition. These design-related elements are accounted for with the term indexical storytelling. As a refinement of the concept of environmental storytelling, indexical storytelling is a productive game design device, since reading the space of the game and learning about the events that have taken place in it are required to traverse the game successfully. Storytelling becomes a game of story-building, since the player has to piece together the story, or construct a story of her own interaction in the world by leaving a trace.},

Fernholz's fly-on-the-wall reporting captures an industry in the midst of disruption. While NASA seeks to preserve its ambitious space program, traditional aerospace firms like Boeing and Lockheed Martin scramble to adapt to new competitors, lobbyists tussle over public funds, and lawmakers try to prevent this new space race from sparking global conflict. It's a high-stakes marathon that Fernholz recounts with expert analysis and revealing detail.},

  abstract = {Background               Video game playing is a daily activity for many youths that replaces other media forms (eg, television); it serves as an important source of knowledge and can potentially impact their attitudes and behaviors. Researchers are, thus, concerned with the impact of video gaming on youth (eg, for promoting prosocial or antisocial behavior). Studies have also begun to explore players' experience of gameplay and video game messages about violence, sexism, and racism; however, little is known about the impact of commercial video games in the sharing and shaping of knowledge, and messages about mental illness.                                         Objective               The aim of this review was to identify how mental illness, especially psychosis, is portrayed in commercial video games.                                         Methods               We performed keyword searches on games made available between January 2016 and June 2017 on Steam (a popular personal computer gaming platform). A total of 789 games were identified and reviewed to assess whether their game content was related to mental illness. At the end of the screening phase, a total of 100 games were retained.                                         Results               We used a game elements framework (characters, game environment/atmosphere, goals, etc) to describe and unpack messages about mental health and illness in video games. The majority of the games we reviewed (97\%, 97/100) portrayed mental illness in negative, misleading, and problematic ways (associating it with violence, fear, insanity, hopelessness, etc). Furthermore, some games portrayed mental illness as manifestations or consequences of supernatural phenomena or paranormal experiences. Mental illness was associated with mystery, the unpredictable, and as an obscure illness; its treatment was also associated with uncertainties, as game characters with mental illness had to undergo experimental treatment to get better. Unfortunately, little or no hope for recovery was present in the identified video games, where mental illness was often presented as an ongoing struggle and an endless battle with the mind and oneself.                                         Conclusions               The game elements of the identified commercial video games included mental illness, about which many perpetuated well-known stereotypes and prejudices. We discuss the key findings in relation to current evidence on the impact of media portrayals of mental illness and stigma. Furthermore, we reflect on the ability of serious video games to promote alternative messages about mental illness and clinical practices. Future research is needed to investigate the impact that such messages have on players and to explore the role that video games can play in fostering alternative messages to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness.},

The 'weird' and the 'eerie' are closely related but distinct modes, each possessing its own distinct properties. Both have often been associated with Horror, yet this emphasis overlooks the aching fascination that such texts can exercise. The 'weird' and the 'eerie' both fundamentally concern the outside and the unknown, which are not intrinsically horrifying, even if they are always unsettling. Perhaps a proper understanding of the human condition requires examination of liminal concepts such as the 'weird' and the 'eerie'. These two modes will be analysed with reference to the work of authors such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, M.R. James, Christopher Priest, Joan Lindsay, Nigel Kneale, Daphne Du Maurier, Alan Garner and Margaret Atwood, and films by Stanley Kubrick, Jonathan Glazer and Christoper Nolan." -- Publisher's description},

  abstract = {An essential exploration of video game aesthetic that decenters the human player and challenges what it means to play.             Do we play video games or do video games play us? Is nonhuman play a mere paradox or the future of gaming? And what do video games have to do with quantum theory? In Playing at a Distance, Sonia Fizek engages with these and many more daunting questions, forging new ways to think and talk about games and play that decenter the human player and explore a variety of play formats and practices that require surprisingly little human action. Idling in clicker games, wandering in walking simulators, automating gameplay with bots, or simply watching games rather than playing them---Fizek shows how these seemingly marginal cases are central to understanding how we play in the digital age.             Introducing the concept of distance, Fizek reorients our view of computer-mediated play. To ``play at a distance,'' she says, is to delegate the immediate action to the machine and to become participants in an algorithmic spectacle. Distance as a media aesthetic framework enables the reader to come to terms with the ambiguity and aesthetic diversity of play.             Drawing on concepts from philosophy, media theory, and posthumanism, as well as cultural and film studies, Playing at a Distance invites a wider understanding of what digital games and gaming are in all their diverse experiences and forms. In challenging the common perception of video games as inherently interactive, the book contributes to our understanding of the computer's influence on practices of play---and prods us to think more broadly about what it means to play.},

  abstract = {The modern project of creating human-like artificial intelligence (AI) started after World War II, when it was discovered that electronic computers are not just number-crunching machines, but can also manipulate symbols. It is possible to pursue this goal without assuming that machine intelligence is identical to human intelligence. This is known as weak AI. However, many AI researcher have pursued the aim of developing artificial intelligence that is in principle identical to human intelligence, called strong AI. Weak AI is less ambitious than strong AI, and therefore less controversial. However, there are important controversies related to weak AI as well. This paper focuses on the distinction between artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). Although AGI may be classified as weak AI, it is close to strong AI because one chief characteristics of human intelligence is its generality. Although AGI is less ambitious than strong AI, there were critics almost from the very beginning. One of the leading critics was the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who argued that computers, who have no body, no childhood and no cultural practice, could not acquire intelligence at all. One of Dreyfus' main arguments was that human knowledge is partly tacit, and therefore cannot be articulated and incorporated in a computer program. However, today one might argue that new approaches to artificial intelligence research have made his arguments obsolete. Deep learning and Big Data are among the latest approaches, and advocates argue that they will be able to realize AGI. A closer look reveals that although development of artificial intelligence for specific purposes (ANI) has been impressive, we have not come much closer to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). The article further argues that this is in principle impossible, and it revives Hubert Dreyfus' argument that computers are not in the world.},

  abstract = {FromSoftware's \emph{Souls} series comprises five separate fictional worlds, and yet is considered a series with a `spiritual' connection. Although the games share the same developer, special attention has been paid, both in popular discourse and in research, to the distinctive character of FromSoftware's worldbuilding and storytelling. I argue that a mythological approach allows us to better outline, analyse and put into relation the elements of these games. Mythology is understood as a model for understanding the world, following the work of Frog (2021) and Roland Barthes ([1972] 2009). This builds on \emph{mytholudics} (Ford 2022), which adapts this understanding for the study of games. Through this, I examine three aspects of a potential Souls mythology: desire and purpose, godhood and divinity, and fire and dark. Additionally, I consider how the \emph{Souls} community negotiates the Souls gameworlds, relating it to the role of folkloric storytellers in communities.},

  shorttitle = {The City, According to City Builders},

  month = oct,
  address = {Leipzig, Germany},
  abstract = {City-builder games allow the player to ``build your dream city'' (SimCity BuildIt, 2023) where ``you're only limited by your imagination'' (Paradox Interactive, n.d.). Of course, those are marketing statements, but most titles emphasise a large degree of creative freedom. Players generally understand that their virtual city is, in fact, limited. Computational power, assets included in the game, gameplay mechanics. But less acknowledged is the degree to which city builders limit the imagination too. The hidden choices---conscious or not---regarding what is and is not possible in gameplay also limit the imagination. Outside of the game too, I argue, these game design decisions play a role in limiting the imagination for what cities can be in general. It is important that city-builder game developers consider the theoretical ramifications and possibilities of their design choices. Likewise, it is important that researchers consider carefully what conceptions of the city these games construct, particularly as they advocate for city builders within the contexts of education and activism. Here, I apply a mythological approach to game analysis (Ford, 2022). This approach is based on Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1972/2009) and Frog's mythic discourse analysis (2021). With this grounding, mythology is approached as a way of expressing meaning rather than a kind of object (in contrast to, e.g., narrative, structuralist or Jungian approaches). Frog sees mythologies as ``models for knowing the world'' (2021, p. 161). A mythological approach to gameworlds here entails examining the gameworld's model of the world. As simulations, the model of city management instantiated by these games reveals a particular set of assumptions regarding how cities function and can be managed. The choices regarding what is simulated (and how) and what is not shows us the limits to the imagination. Examples of these choices have been raised before: the role of the `player-mayor' in \emph{SimCity} (Maxis, 1989) (Friedman, 1999); the need for cities in \emph{SimCity} (Maxis Emeryville, 2013) to be profitable (K\l osi\'nski, 2016); the way the \emph{SimCity} games force the player into creating a car-centric, North American-style metropolis (Pedercini, 2017). The need for further study of city builders in this way is twofold. First, the vast majority of research into city builders focuses on the \emph{SimCity} series. Of course, the genre has always been much broader, and many have not considered SimCity to be the standard-bearer of the genre since the disastrous release of \emph{SimCity} (2013) and the subsequent release of \emph{Cities: Skylines} (Colossal Order, 2015) (see Livingston, 2015). In this context, it is important to examine to what extent analyses of \emph{SimCity} can be taken as paradigmatic. Second, city builders (and, again, \emph{SimCity} in particular) continue to be of interest for game-based learning (e.g., Adams, 1998; Andreoletti \& Cappello, 2013; Arnold et al., 2019; Glasslab Games, 2013; Khan \& Zhao, 2021; Kim \& Shin, 2016; Manocchia, 1999; Minnery \& Searle, 2014; Woessner, 2015). Many of these works do encourage educators to approach the games critically as limited simulations that make assumptions. Nonetheless, it is important to arm future pedagogical approaches with robust arguments that lay out those implicit assumptions. In particular---relating to the first point---arguments that pertain to the genre as a whole are almost nonexistent (with notable exceptions, such as Bereitschaft, 2015). I provide an overview of the city builder genre, identifying mythologies shared across the genre. I also acknowledge the exceptions, such as \emph{Terra Nil} (Free Lives, 2023), arguing that we need more of those to expand our imaginings of city design and management. Crucially, I argue that these exceptions demonstrate that innovative city builder games can expand our imaginative horizons for what cities can and should be.},

  abstract = {It's a utopian vision for games: endlessly talk to nonplayers characters (NPCs), freely, about anything, and have them respond in-character directly to your specific utterance, unshackled from the limitations of a script. Such a vision is closer to reality, some believe, with the help of recent advances in large language models (LLMs), exemplified in applications like ChatGPT. Andrea L. Guzman and Seth C. Lewis call applications like ChatGPT communicative AI, AIs ``designed to carry out specific tasks within the communication process that were formerly associated with humans'' (2020, 72). Much of the critical academic research focus has been on the impacts of communicative AIs in other communicative arenas, such as higher education (Playfoot, Quigley, and Thomas 2024), public health (Biswas 2023) and dating (Hou, Leach, and Huang 2024). So far, less research has focused critically on the role of communicative AIs in digital games. The research that exists (see Sweetser 2024) is primarily focused on technical and design challenges, even within game narrative and NPC dialogue. Little research has considered the critical or theoretical implications of communicative AI in game design, even in its most prominent sphere of use: NPC dialogue. Andreas Hepp et al. argue that, in principle, communicative AI: (1) is based on various forms of automation designed for the central purpose of communication, (2) is embedded within digital infrastructures, and (3) is entangled with human practices. (2023, 48) When research does not thoroughly engage with especially that third point, how it is entangled with human practices, then we miss a vital aspect: ``the processing of these systems cannot be understood beyond human practice'' (Hepp et al. 2023, 49). Entanglement here refers to Karen Barad: ``individuals do not pre-exist their interactions; rather, individuals emerge through and as part of their entangled intra-relating'' (2006, ix). Communicative AI is entangled in both use and production, as LLMs are trained on real human communication. Therefore, we should not consider these as novel, separate technologies, but as developments deeply intertwined with our past and present communication. Hepp et al. argue that this is how we avoid buying into the hype of generative AI ourselves: ``we should take note of the hype \emph{insofar} as it may stand for a fundamental change in the ways we all communicate'' (Hepp et al. 2023, 53). I argue that the use of communicative AI in NPC dialogue may constitute such a fundamental change, and so deserves critical attention. Here, then, I map the current state of the field both in terms of research and applications. What has been done, what are researchers writing about it, and what are they not writing about it? Then I briefly lay out a potential fruitful area of theoretical discussion: the philosophy of fiction. I show how we can draw on critical insights from existing research on AI in other domains. I end with a call for further critical, theoretical research coming from the our various disciplines and intersections within game studies on this topic. Communicative AI for NPCs is not new. Perhaps the earliest example was \emph{Fa\c cade} (Mateas and Stern 2005), which uses natural language processing in conjunction with a ``drama manager'' that manages story beats (Mateas and Stern 2003, 7). But, by their own admission, \emph{Fa\c cade} is ``a 20 minute one-act play replayable 6 or 7 times before it is exhausted'' (2003, 4). More recent applications using newer LLM technology boast loftier ambitions. A popular mod for \emph{The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim} (Bethesda Game Studios 2011), \emph{Mantella}, promises to ``bring every NPC to life with AI'' (ArtFromTheMachine 2023). \emph{Inworld Origins} (Inworld AI 2023), a tech demo, puts AI NPCs at the core of the game as witnesses that the player, as a detective, can question. Or consider \emph{AI Dungeon} (Latitude 2019), which uses GPT-3 (originally GPT-2) to generate a text adventure roleplaying game. These three examples constitute three important use cases for communicative AI. \emph{Mantella} demonstrates AI's addition to an older game via mods; \emph{Inworld Origins} is a demo game intended to show the power of the technology with AI NPCs at the core of the game; and \emph{AI Dungeon} is a retail game for which the entire gameworld, including NPCs, is generated. These three examples could point to fundamental shifts regarding how we communicate with gameworlds and NPCs, such that they pose new challenges to existing theory. For instance, the philosophy of fiction and its application to digital games. As an example, Nele Van de Mosselaer and Stefano Gualeni (2023) introduce the \emph{implied designer}, a ``conceptualization of a designer that the player constructs'' to whom ``the player ascribes all the intentions that they think underpin the creation of that particular game'' (2023, 76). Players make sense of gameworlds at least in part based on what \emph{intentions} they perceive as being behind their artificial construction. How do AI-generated NPC dialogues affect this? On the one hand, far from making the gameworld ``come alive'', it could kill it by removing or at least clouding that aspect of intentionality that is crucial to our making sense of it. On the other hand, we may just need to better conceptualise what specific role the AI is playing. In a forthcoming paper, Yuqian Sun and Stefano Gualeni (Forthcoming) use the metaphors of \emph{puppet} and \emph{actor}, arguing that while they attribute more agency to AI actors in general, even in the metaphor of a puppet we can see the intentionality of the puppet master behind it. That is, we may still see the salient intentionality in the restrictions, affordances and guardrails of any given communicative AI model, even if human intentionality is a step further removed. Further critical and theoretical research in this vein is needed if we are to understand how the experience of playing games shapes and is shaped by advances in communicative AI technology. Industry giants like Ubisoft have already shown great interest in the technology, so it is only a matter of time before such NPCs are commonplace in mainstream digital games. Let's not wait until the horse has bolted.},

I had to feel around with my hands and breath, guess their shape and size and hopefully find a way to never be hurt by them again.

  abstract = {\emph{Civilization V} as one of the most successful and definitive works of the 4X videogame genre presents a clear narrative of empire-building that, I will argue, is problematic when set against postcolonial theory. With many studies lauding the series for its educational capacities I argue that with an affective turn to the role of the player, the game's homogenization of narratives of societal progression reinforces a Western-centric notion of history. This co-opts non-colonial societies into imperialism, while in the process silencing their histories. For this study, I will read the game's goals and mechanics through postcolonial theorists such as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and Michel-Rolph Trouillot, and then turn to affect theory to consider what role the player takes in writing this history. To conclude, I will consider what implications this has on the use of 4X games like \emph{Civilization V} for education and the conception of history in the minds of the players, drawing on other recent scholars who have similarly problematized the series.},

  abstract = {Too monstrous to be truly accepted, too human to be entirely and comfortably cast out. The giant has traditionally held a unique position amongst monsters, an "Intimate Stranger" (Cohen, 1999, p. xi) who threatens the boundaries of the categories we impose upon the self, society and culture. In this thesis, I consider what the position of the giant is in digital roleplaying games and how digital games provide a new and particular arena for the giant. A familiar figure in myth and legend and no less familiar in digital games, I combine traditional monster theory and scholarship on giants with work on videogame monsters and digital game research more broadly. To do this, I first introduce the figure of the giant and its definition and then undertake a brief literature review, summing up the present state of videogame monster research and other theories which are relevant to my thinking and arguments. Then, I consider the giant in digital roleplaying games through three lenses. First, as monsters of excess, a perspective that considers giants as an exaggerated manifestation of those traits which we deem monstrous when taken to their extremes. Second, as technological giants: giant robots, cyborgs and so on whose appearance as giants links the age-old figure of the giant with our more current anxieties regarding our future and our increasingly intimate relationship with technology. Finally, as aspects of nature: giants that seem to be more a living part of the gameworld than as a horrifying and excessive human monster. I explore how these giants seem to relate more to how we think of and understand our relationship with nature, from its sublime beauty to its hostile wildernesses. To conclude, I attempt to draw these perspectives together to gain an oversight on what role the giant plays within digital roleplaying games, arguing that the giant is a particular figure used to consider and work through our socio-cultural anxieties at the most fundamental level and is one that requires medium-specific consideration within game studies.},

  abstract = {This dissertation aims to situate moral play under a structure of godhood. This comprise two distinct but intertwining elements: the player-as-god and diegetic gods. The player-as-god is a concept I will outline that describes the player-avatar relationship as a dualistic notion that encompasses the avatar as a distinct, diegetic character, and the player as a controlling being who transcends the gameworld. The two collide in player-avatar relationships to create a `fantasy self', as Katherine Isbister terms, that is neither solely player nor avatar. The player-as-god, as both transcendental but simultaneously native to the gameworld, must forge new moral and social frameworks according to the different ontological and cosmological fundamentals of the created gameworld. These frameworks, I will argue, are predicated on higher diegetic powers that guide and inform the player-as-god. I will examine this topic through four case studies. In \emph{Grand Theft Auto V}, I will illustrate the player-as-god as part of a player-avatar relationship that involves a pre-characterised avatar, in the form of \emph{GTA V}'s playable protagonists. In \emph{The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim}, I will analyse a more `blank slate' avatar in the player-avatar relationship, and consider how the player-as-god is directed by diegetic gameworld gods and higher powers. In \emph{Diablo III}, I will explore the highly intertextual nature of its moral framework, as it borrows extensively from Judeo-Christian tradition. Finally, in \emph{Dark Souls} I will add a moral dimension to Daniel Vella's notion of the ludic sublime, examine how moral futility is instituted in the game's lore and mechanics.},

  abstract = {Background               Researchers and therapists have increasingly turned to digital games for new forms of treatments and interventions for people suffering from a variety of mental health issues. Yet, the depiction of mental illness within digital games typically promotes stigmatized versions of those with mental health concerns. Recently, more games have attempted to implement more realistic and respectful depictions of mental health conditions.                                         Objective               This paper presents an exploratory analysis of a contemporary game that has the potential to change the way researchers, practitioners, and game designers approach topics of mental health within the context of gaming.                                         Methods               A case study of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice was conducted using frame analysis to show how key design choices for this game present the potential for new ways of approaching games and mental health.                                         Results               A case study of Hellblade's development shows how research-informed collaborative design with mental health practitioners, scientists, and individuals with mental health problems can lead to a realistic depiction of mental illness in games. Furthermore, the use of frame analysis demonstrates how to harness narrative, mechanics, and technology to create embodied experiences of mental health, which has the potential to promote empathetic understanding.                                         Conclusions               This paper highlights an exemplary case of collaborative commercial game design for entertainment purposes in relation to mental health. Understanding the success of Hellblade's depiction of psychosis can improve serious games research and design. Further research must continue to provide deeper analysis of not only games that depict mental illness, but also the design process behind them.},

Through the lens of Jacques Derrida's hauntology, I consider how this construction is used in these two popular and prevalent yet different examples to evoke nostalgia for their own fictional pasts. I analyse the ways in which the ghosts of these gameworlds haunt the player in the present, through modalities of threat, nostalgia, lost futures and destiny. These manifest on various levels of the game: the gameworlds' fictional pasts (often overlapping with what would popularly be called a game's "lore"); digital materiality; and the games' spatial environments and the traversal of them. The examples differ in how and why the player interfaces with the gameworlds' ghosts on each layer, opening up some of the potential strategies for this game-internal nostalgia and haunting, while not being exhaustive.},

Positioned between the categories of ``pure'' and the ``monstrous'' is the player character, Jin, a liminal figure who blurs these two categories.

But history may be repeating itself, as developers Colossal Order and publishers Paradox Interactive are facing a backlash to the launch of the hotly anticipated \emph{Cities: Skylines II} (2023). While studies have been conducted into games which had poor launches, like \emph{No Man's Sky} (Hello Games, 2016; see Chien et al., 2020) and \emph{Cyberpunk 2077} (CD Projekt Red, 2020; see Siuda et al., 2023), these focus on the games' celebrated turnarounds, rather than on the period of the launch itself. The extensive cost of game development means a single failure can be catastrophic, as evidenced by \emph{SimCity} developer Maxis Emeryville being shut down as a consequence of the poor launch. Yet these events seem to be becoming an increasingly common occurrence. Here, I analyse a snapshot of player reaction and discourse to \emph{Cities II}'s launch. 30 threads have been scraped from the subreddit /r/CitiesSkylines2 and coded using an open coding approach based on grounded theory (Gibbs, 2018, p. 67) to build a picture of themes of player speculation regarding why the launch was poor.},

  abstract = {The hero of prophecy is a construction that seems more at home in fantasy than science fiction. And yet, many of digital gaming's most popular sci-fi gameworlds cannot escape it. Interestingly, however, they try to hide the fact. Convoluted explanations, usually involving genetics, are deployed to maintain the pretence of reason in a decidedly fantastical heroic construction. I explore how and why this occurs through two examples: the allohistorical \emph{Assassin's Creed} (2007--2025) and \emph{Horizon} series (2017--2024). Both series' science-fiction settings find themselves at pains to rationally explain how their central heroes are not incidental but fated, one through genetic lineage the other through cloning. This is a trend observed in videogames more broadly (Jennings, 2022). I analyse these series heroes through \emph{mytholudics} (Ford, 2025), a method for understanding games as and through contemporary myth: both how they are influenced by myth, but also operate as mythic gameworlds themselves. Through this, I argue that we can understand these examples as fundamentally fantastical heroes in a `scientised' setting. I ask what we can learn from this tension between the magical and the rational and the role of heroism in supposedly disenchanted settings.},

  abstract = {The late 14th-century poem \emph{Sir Gawain and the Green Knight} (Anderson 1996) and Daniel Mullins Games' recent roguelike deck-building digital game \emph{Inscryption} (2021) have in common the narrative frame of a game. In this paper, we examine these as examples of the very concept of the `magic circle' of games being used to evoke dread, horror or uncanniness. In both examples, the protagonists are trapped within a game and forced to play. Crucially, the rules of these games are enforced and adhered to strictly by the antagonists, even though in their roles as game masters they could easily tip the scales in their favour. This can also be seen in many other popular media, such as \emph{Tron} (Lisberger 1982), \emph{Battle Royale} (Fukasaku 2000), the \emph{Saw} franchise (2004--2023) and \emph{Squid Game} (Dong-hyuk 2021). However, the reason behind choosing these examples is (a) to explore an as-yet little-researched but critically acclaimed game, \emph{Inscryption}, (b) to link it to much longer-running traditions and techniques via \emph{Gawain}, and (c) to show by way of comparison the particular role that digital games can play in using the `magic prison'. \emph{Gawain} begins on New Year's Eve when a mysterious green knight enters Arthur's court and presents a strange challenge: any knight present can strike a blow on him, provided that the knight may return the blow a year and one day later. Sir Gawain accepts the challenge with a cunning idea: behead the knight and he will not be able to return the blow. However, the decapitated green knight picks up his head and leaves the court, reminding Gawain of his agreement. In the beginning of \emph{Inscryption}, the player-character appears to be trapped in a cabin with a shadowy card dealer called Leshy. Though the player may move around the cabin freely, they may not leave. Eventually, they must play a roguelike deck-builder game, for which Leshy is the game master. Leshy upholds the rules of the game rigorously. Even if the player has acquired a card from the cabin, Leshy frustratedly allows the player to play with it on the basis that now that it is in their deck, it is valid. The game becomes increasingly metafictional, and through found footage we understand that a vlogger named Luke Carder has come into possession of a seemingly cursed game disk, but to defeat the curse he must play the game to its conclusion. In both examples, we see an oddly strict adherence to arbitrary and not-fully-explained game rules, despite the stakes in both being literally life and death. This turns the `magic circle' into a `magic prison', whereby the notion of voluntary, rule-bound, separated play becomes threatening. The two examples are also linked by a number of parallels which may be fruitful to explore. For instance, both the green knight and Leshy have some close connection with nature, and this link juxtaposes with the arbitrariness of bounded play. Both antagonists also shapeshift or roleplay as gamemasters, assuming the roles of the other characters we meet. The magic circle is a concept briefly described by Johan Huizinga ([1938] 2014), but primarily developed by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman (2003) where the term entered game studies in earnest. Salen and Zimmerman use the term to describe how voluntarily beginning a game creates a `magic circle', separated from ordinary life and in which players agree to play by arbitrary rules and assign special meaning to game pieces. The concept has been vigorously discussed and criticized within the field since. Most commonly critiqued is the degree of separation from ordinary life (e.g., Consalvo 2009; Pargman and Jakobsson 2008), but also arguments regarding the computational nature of digital games compared with nondigital games (Liebe 2008). However, others have defended the concept, arguing that its detractors take the metaphor too literally---what Jaakko Stenros calls the ``strong boundary hypothesis'' (2012, 4). The point here is that examples such as \emph{Inscryption} and \emph{Gawain} evoke the notion of the magic circle but subvert it. Both show a warped sense of voluntariness. In \emph{Inscryption}, while the player may not leave and must eventually play with Leshy, they may freely walk around the cabin and choose when to play and when to get up from the table and pause play. Gawain is bound only by honour to uphold his end of the bargain. This quasi-voluntariness problematizes the boundary between game and ordinary life. By raising the stakes of the game to life and death, the boundedness of the magic circle becomes a prison in which the player is forced to pseudo-voluntarily engage in the game. The juxtaposition between the arbitrariness and lusory attitude of adhering to the game rules combined with the involuntariness and fatal consequences is the engine for dread in these works. We explore the implications that these examples have on conceptions of the magic circle and how the conventions of games can become the focus for a specific type of horror or dread.},

Here, I understand it through Roland Barthes' assertion that myth is not a thing, an object, or a genre of story, but a way of expressing meaning. This allows us to see how discourse everywhere -- not just in narratives -- and everywhen -- not only in ancient times as something we have `moved beyond' -- operates mythically.   Mytholudics couples this with Frog's mythic discourse analysis, a modern folklore approach to laying out more concretely how ``integers'' of mythic discourse amongst a group come together in a particular time. The result is something which can account for stories, but also more disconnected, dispersed and fragmentary, but no less important, mythic constructions, like singular events, superstitions, taboos, social relations, and so on. ``When myths are defined as stories, we may see stories where there are none,'' Frog warns (2018, p. 10). Instead, we should see myths as models for understand the world and things in it.   Mytholudics adapts mythic discourse analysis for the study of games, taking into account games' virtuality -- that they are neither real nor wholly fictional, but worlds be can act within -- nonlinearity -- that games are often experienced nonlinearly and nonprescriptively both in terms of space and time -- and performativity -- that games are played and so approaching them as a static artefact is not enough, we must also approach them as performances. Because gameworlds are emulated worlds, they produce meaning both through myth, in that they inevitably draw on `real-world' myths in their constructions, and as myth, in that they are worlds in themselves with their own internal logics, relations, histories and meanings.   In this keynote, I lay out what mytholudics is and how you can use it. I do this through examples of how Victorian and American myths inform and constitute the gameworlds we inhabit.},

  abstract = {Games create worlds made of many different elements, but also of rules, systems and structures for how we act in them. So how can we make sense of them? \emph{Mytholudics: Games and Myth} lays out an approach to understanding games using theories from myth and folklore. Myth is taken here not as an object but as a process, a \emph{way} of expressing meaning. It works to naturalise arbitrary constellations of signs, to connect things in meaning. Behind the phrase `just the way it is' is a process of mythologization that has cemented it. Mytholudics lays out how this understanding of myth works for the analysis of games. In two sections each analysing five digital games, it then shows how this approach works in practice: one through the lens of heroism and one through monstrosity. These ask questions such as what heroic mythology is constructed in \emph{Call of Duty}? What do the monsters in \emph{The Witcher} tell us about the game's model of the world? How does \emph{Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice} weave a conflict between Norse and Pictish mythology into one between competing models of seeing mental illness? This method helps to see games and their worlds in the whole. Stories, gameplay, systems, rules, spatial configurations and art styles can all be considered together as contributing to the meaning of the game.},

  abstract = {This dissertation outlines a mythological framework for understanding how games produce meaning. The central question is: how does a mythological approach help to understand the way games make meaning? I first theorise mythology as it applies to games and play. This is expressed through a cycle showing how mythology is embedded into the production of games as well as how it impacts the playing and interpretation of games. This is then operationalised as a method for the analysis of games. I call my theorisation and analytical approach mytholudics. With this established, I apply mytholudics in ten analyses of individual games or game series, split into two lenses: heroism and monstrosity. Finally, I reflect on these analyses and on mytholudics as an approach. Mythology here is understood primarily from two theoretical perspectives: Roland Barthes' theory outlined in \emph{Mythologies} (1972/2009) and Frog's (2015, 2021a) understanding of mythology in cultural practice and discourse from a folklore studies perspective. The Barthesian approach establishes myth as a mode of expression rather than as an object, a mode that is therefore prevalent in all forms of media and meaning-making. This mode of expression has naturalisation as a key feature, by which the arbitrariness of second-order signification is masked. Otherwise arbitrary relations between things are made to seem obvious and natural. Frog's mythic discourse approach understands mythology as ``constituted of signs that are emotionally invested by people within a society as models for knowing the world'' (2021a, p. 161). Frog outlines mythic discourse analysis as a method which focuses on the comparison of mythic discourse over time and across cultures. Barthes and Frog broadly share an understanding of mythology as a particular way of communicating an understanding of the world through discourse. From this perspective, mythology is not limited to any genre, medium or cultural context. It can include phenomena as diverse as systems, rules, customs, behaviours, rituals, stories, characters, events, social roles, motifs, spatial configurations, and so on. What is important is how these elements are placed in relation to one another. This stands in contrast to certain understandings of myth which may position it as a narrative genre or a socioreligious function of `primitive' societies. Games consist of the same diverse elements arranged in comparable configurations, and so this perspective highlights the otherwise hidden parallels between mythology and games. Therefore, a mythological approach can help us to understand the game as an organising structure in which different and diverse elements are put into relation with one another in order to produce meaning. To develop this framework, I argue for analysing games as and through myth. Games as myth means viewing the game as an organising structure that works analogously to mythology. Elements are constructed and put into relation with one another within a gameworld, which the player then plays in and interprets. Games through myth means seeing games as embedded within cultural contexts. The cultural context of development affects the mythologies that can be seen to influence the construction of the game, while the cultural context of the player affects how they relate to and interact with the game and the mythologies channelled through it. With the theorisation and methodology laid out, I exemplify the mytholudic approach by applying it to ten analyses of individual games or game series, split into two chapters of five analyses each. The first considers the games through the lens of heroism, defined as the positive mythologisation of an individual. To help with comparison and understanding, I outline a number of hero-types, broad categories based on different rhetorics of heroism. These include the hero-victim, the hero-sceptic, the preordained hero and the unsung hero. The examples analysed are the \emph{Call of Duty} series (2003--2022), \emph{The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim} (Bethesda Game Studios, 2011), the \emph{Assassin's Creed} series (2007--2022), \emph{Heaven's Vault} (Inkle, 2019) and \emph{Horizon Zero Dawn} (Guerrilla Games, 2017). The second considers the games through the lens of monstrosity, defined broadly as a form of negative mythologisation of an entity. Like with heroes, I outline a number of monster-types based on where their monstrosity is said to come from. These are the monster from within, the monster from without, the artificial monster and the monster of nature. The game examples are \emph{Doom} (id Software, 1993a), the \emph{Pok\'emon} series (Game Freak, 1996--2022), \emph{Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice} (Ninja Theory, 2017), \emph{Ghost of Tsushima} (Sucker Punch Productions, 2020a) and \emph{The Witcher} series (CD Projekt Red, 2007--2016). Finally, I synthesise these two lenses in a chapter reflecting on the hero- and monster-types, all ten analyses and the mytholudic approach in general. I argue that a mytholudic approach helps us to understand how games make meaning because it focuses on the naturalised and hidden premises that go into the construction of games as organising structures. By analysing the underpinnings of those organising structures, we can outline the model for understanding the world that is virtually instantiated and how they are influenced by, influence and relate to models for understanding the world---mythologies---in the real world.},

In doing so, we can also use myth as a way to understand gameworlds. Games both make use of existing `real-world' myths as well as `emulating' the process in the creation of fictional worlds that we can play within. Understanding games and myths as models allows us to put them together to better analyse how players inhabit and behave within games, and how they interpret them, both with reference to the gameworld itself as a self-contained `universe' as well as with reference to the real-world influences that the developers are undeniably influenced by.},

  title = {Player Democracy in {{{\emph{Old School RuneScape}}}}},
  author = {Ford, Dom},
  year = 2025,
  month = may,
  address = {Turku, Finland},
  abstract = {Cambridge-based developer Jagex released \emph{Old School RuneScape} (OSRS) in 2013, following years of backlash to the direction of the long-running MMORPG \emph{RuneScape} (2001). OSRS opened its servers alongside the main game based on a 2007 backup, effectively removing six years of updates. OSRS overtook the average player count of \emph{RuneScape} in 2016 and has the gap has only increased in the years since. But the game has not remained stagnant. Indeed, OSRS has now had more years of development (2013--2025) than \emph{RuneScape} had had up until the 2007 backup (2001--2007). To try to maintain the `old school spirit' of the game -- and in response to a lack of trust in Jagex that had led to the dissatisfaction in the main game in the first place -- OSRS is updated according to an unusual form of player democracy. Jagex propose updates and players vote `Yes' or `No' to their implementation. A proposed update requires a supermajority of `yes' votes (75\% until 2022, 70\% thereafter) to be implemented. This means that both developers and players alike actively campaign for or against proposed or potential updates to the game. I examine player attitudes towards OSRS' voting system and what this may entail for the potential future of player democracy in other contexts. I do this via a qualitative content analysis following Udo Kuckartz and Stefan R\"adiker (2023). I will scrape the comment trees of 20 relevant threads in the game's quasi-official forum, the subreddit /r/2007scape, and inductively code the posts. This will establish a number of themes, strands of thinking regarding how players perceive the voting system and how they negotiate their position in the player democracy. The data will be gathered and coded in February and March 2025. The presentation will then consist of my preliminary analyses, broader theoretical considerations and the potential benefits and problems with player democracy more widely applied. Player democracy is rare in digital games -- certainly on the scale of OSRS. The intuitive reason why it is not common is the risk of developer work being `wasted' after failure to secure player approval. The Sailing skill was an example of this, being proposed in 2015, developed fairly extensively, only to receive 68\% `yes' votes -- an over-two-thirds majority, yet still not reaching the threshold. The skill was scrapped, and only reemerged as a serious proposal in 2023, totally redesigned. On the other hand, I hypothesise that a meaningful player democracy makes for a playerbase that feels more engaged and invested in and more valued by the game's development.  There is little research into this kind of player democracy. A closely related topic would be co-creation in digital games, ``the change of the design of existing games through participation in the production of the game by players'' (Prax 2016, 36). OSRS' voting system could constitute co-creation under Prax's definition, However, so far, research in this area has focused on player co-creation in the form of mods (Reisinho, Raposo, and Zagalo 2024), in-game tools to produce new content (Kohler et al. 2011) or in the design of a game prior to release (De Jans et al. 2017). OSRS offers a model for a different kind of co-creation, if player democracy is to be understood as a kind of co-creation. Studying player democracy may also help to better understand how players understand and relate to their position as players, fans, community members and consumers. This is because discussions surrounding polling appear to often become meta-discussions about what the core philosophy of the game is or should be (`old school-ness'), how Jagex can build and maintain trust with the community, what the point of the polling system is, its benefits and drawbacks, and the practicalities of game development. I will also consider the specifics of OSRS and its position as a long-running MMORPG that created a `classic' version, akin to the later \emph{World of Warcraft Classic} (Blizzard Entertainment 2019). OSRS was one of the first MMORPGs in what has become a trend. Research has so far focused on \emph{World of Warcraft Classic} and on the concept of nostalgia (Robinson and Bowman 2022; Toft-Nielsen 2019). The aspect of nostalgia may also apply here in the perceived need to define and vociferously protect `old school-ness', making it a more emotionally charged subject or making `old school-ness' more dependent on one's own nostalgia for the RuneScape-that-was prior to OSRS. The presentation will therefore focus on a preliminary theoretical situating of the coded dataset through the lenses of co-creation in the broad sense, and of `classic' MMORPGs more specifically. This will help to better understand what aspects of OSRS' player democracy can and cannot be potentially extrapolated to wider game design practices.},

  abstract = {In \emph{How To Do Things With Videogames}, Ian Bogost argues that videogames offer ``an experience of the `space between points' that had been reduced or eliminated by the transportation technologies that began with the train'' (2011, 49). But when we watch a speedrun of a game such as \emph{The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time} (Nintendo EAD 1998), what we instead see is a player determined to destroy as much of that `space between points' as possible. It is a game that takes most players tens of hours to complete, but is finished in just over 17 minutes by the best speedrunners, utilizing glitches that manipulate the game's code to skip enormous chunks of both the narrative and the gameworld. Once an underground hobby conducted between users swapping footage on obscure internet forums, speedrunning has shot into the mainstream in recent years following the rise of livestreaming platforms and livestreamed events such as Games Done Quick and the European Speedsters Assembly. So what does speedrunning mean as a mode of play, and what can it reveal about the relationship between player and gameworld? This paper examines speedrunning as a transgressive mode of play. Building on previous work on this topic by scholars such as Rainforest Scully-Blaker, I first aim to define speedrunning as a practice and then to explore its relationship with the space in the gameworld, the game's narrative, and with the ideological and representational implications that arise from them. To do this, I bring in spatial, digital and videogame theorists such as Paul Virilio, Tom Apperley and Espen Aarseth, as well as work on other transgressive spatial practices such as parkour in order to see if and how they relate.},

  abstract = {\emph{Cities: Skylines} (Colossal Order, 2015) took the city-builder throne from Maxis' \emph{SimCity} series (1989--2014) after the disastrous launch of the fifth \emph{SimCity} (Maxis Emeryville, 2013). But history may be repeating itself, as developers Colossal Order and publishers Paradox Interactive are facing a backlash to the launch of the hotly anticipated \emph{Cities: Skylines II} (2023). Apologetic forum posts from CEO Mariina Hallikainen, promised features significantly delayed, a slew of poor reviews and a rapidly dwindling playerbase all plague a game which was meant to consolidate Colossal Order's rule over the genre. Digital games are a notoriously complex and opaque creative industry. Developers have complained that players are ``disconnected \dots{} from the realities of game development, and yet they speak with complete authority'' (Pagliarulo, 2023) and others have observed tension between the mystification of games as an artistic practice on one hand and the slew of technical and financial restraints on the other (Bycer, 2019). Recent books such as Brendan Keogh's show that we still struggle to grasp what game development entails and the ``complex picture of numerous, diffuse sites of videogame production'' (2023, p. 152). Players' grasp of this is not helped by the industry's ``secretive and \dots{} closed-source culture'' (Politowski et al., 2021, p. 1), as anyone who has asked a game developer acquaintance what they are working on will attest. The often-extensive cost of game development---both financial and temporal---means that a single failure can be catastrophic, sometimes leading to the closure of even well-established studios, such as Maxis Emeryville. No developer or publisher aims for a disastrous launch. But, lauded turnarounds like that of \emph{No Man's Sky} (Hello Games, 2016, 2018; see: Chien et al., 2020) and \emph{Cyberpunk 2077} (CD Projekt Red, 2020; see: Siuda et al., 2023) suggest that this need not be the end of \emph{Skylines II}. Community management could be crucial in recovering from a disappointing launch. As such, more research is needed into how players understand and respond to poor launches, which could inform how to better manage these unhappy occurrences. To do this, I will scrape the comments of the top 50 posts from the game's dedicated Reddit forum, /r/CitiesSkylines2. A sample of the 100 longest comments, chosen on the basis that they are more likely to have a fleshed-out and coherent argument with necessary context, will be used to inductively develop open, preliminary codes (Auerbach \& Silverstein, 2003). These codes will then be applied to the rest of the corpus, being modified as necessary. The codes will be developed on the basis of players' perceived reasons for why the launch of \emph{Cities II} struggled. Analysis of the resulting dataset, aided by the qualitative analysis software 4CAT (Peeters \& Hagen, 2022), will help to lay out and better understand the predominant strands of players' views of poor launches, and whether they align with the realities of game development and the perceptions of disgruntled developers. Studies such as those cited of \emph{No Man's Sky} and \emph{Cyberpunk 2077} are important for analysing player receptions to `salvaged' games. But, so far, little research has looked at the phenomenon of the poor launch itself and how players understand and respond to it. This research may also help to inform work on community churn (Bergstrom \& Poor, 2021, 2022)---especially as the long, spirited discussions surrounding a poor launch may tie into an increased sense of community when a game is perceived to be in a state of crisis (cf. Xu, 2018)---and research on negative digital game community dynamics (Hodgdon, 2018). Better knowledge in this domain could also inform community management practices for game launches.},

  year = 2024,

  address = {Bremen, Germany},
  abstract = {Digital games are often understood in terms of escapism, the avoidance of everyday, `real' life. But are gameworlds necessarily escapist? I argue that this escapist paradigm reveals an underlying assumption that gameworlds are separate from the `real world'. Instead, I propose that we can better understand gameworlds and their role in our lives and in society through the concept of \emph{otherworlding} (Frog, 2020). Otherworld describes a variety of usually spiritual and/or geographic places which are in some way separate from the `ordinary' world. The afterlives in various religions, for instance, overlapping spirit realms, fairyland in English and Scottish folklore. However, Frog observes issues with the term in that what makes an otherworld `other' ``is invariably linked to a perspective of what is `not other''' (2020, p. 455). Imposing inherent qualities such as `supernatural' flattens the role an otherworld plays in its society. Instead, Frog suggests we turn our attention to otherworlding as a process ``of othering linked to places and spaces, contrasting `ours' or `the familiar' with `other' \dots{} the familiar or recognizable forms a frame of reference against which fractions of difference become emphasized'' (2020, p. 458), drawing on concepts of othering (from, e.g., de Beauvoir, 1949/2011; Irvine \& Gal, 2000). Otherworlding allows us to avoid false binaries, and instead focus on processes and the dynamics of power and control that determine the construction of places. Who or what is being othered, by whom, on what basis, and to what end? What is `normal' in contrast to which this world is other? Otherworlding can in this way be applied to gameworlds too. Doing so allows us to see past the notion that gameworlds are fundamentally separate from the `real world', to which players can `escape'. This distinction has long been challenged in game studies (Klastrup \& Tosca, 2004; Mortensen, 2018; Radde-Antweiler et al., 2014; Taylor, 2009), and is also implicitly challenged by frameworks beyond game studies such as deep mediatisation, which stresses the fundamental technological interrelatedness of media (Couldry \& Hepp, 2017, pp. 54--55). But while these perspectives are vital for understanding that gameworlds are inseparable from wider society, otherworlding recognises that there is in fact an intention to separate gameworlds, to construe them as an otherworld. I argue that otherworlding is a valuable way to view gameworlds as separated spaces without buying into the asserted disconnection from society. This helps us to grasp both what the construction of a gameworld as a whole says about the society from which it emerged, but also how the persistence and proliferation of particular gameworlds may impact back on society at large. And it enables us to show how gameworlds are not homogenous in construction and impact, but are fluid, porous and constantly negotiated spaces. To exemplify how gameworlds can be analysed through otherworlding, I will present an analysis of the popular fantasy action roleplaying game \emph{Elden Ring} (FromSoftware, 2022) and its surrounding community, which is well-known both for its dedication to and passion for the game and FromSoftware's other titles, but is also embroiled in controversial discussions surrounding exclusionary community practices (Orme, 2022). With this example, we can explore otherworlding both through the creation of and investment in a fantastical fictional world, but also the way in which players form a community surrounding that world, demarcating digital spaces in which different social rules, structures and relations apply.},

This project uses textual analysis to examine the way these maps and navigational aids inform the experience of spatiality in Fallout 3, BioShock and BioShock 2. Spatiality is understood as trialectic, incorporating perceived, conceived and lived space, drawing on the work of Henri Lefebvre and Edward Soja. The most prominent elements of the games' maps and navigational aids are analysed in terms of how they inform players' experience of the games' spaces. In particular this project examines the in-game maps these games incorporate, the waypoint navigation and fast-travel systems in Fallout 3, and the guide arrow and environmental cues in the BioShock games.},

In particular, the study focuses on a specific video game, Horizon Zero Dawn (2017). Firstly, this paper analyses the traditional female models promoted in video games and their influence on the construction of gender ideals. Then, Horizon Zero Dawn is explored, paying attention to the representation of femininity and masculinity within the game, as it emerges through its main characters and their interactions within the narrative. The contribution analyses a specific case study in order to investigate the potential influence of non-stereotyped narrative video games on the perception of gender norms.},

  abstract = {"Monsters, ghosts, fantastic beings, and supernatural phenomena of all sorts haunt the folklore and popular culture of Japan. Broadly labeled 'yokai,' these creatures come in infinite shapes and sizes, from tengu mountain goblins and kappa water spirits to shape-shifting foxes and long-tongued ceiling-lickers. Currently popular in anime, manga, film, and computer games, many yokai originated in local legends, folktales, and regional ghost stories. Drawing on years of research in Japan, Michael Dylan Foster unpacks the history and cultural context of yokai, tracing their roots, interpreting their meanings, and introducing people who have hunted them through the ages. In this delightful and accessible narrative, readers will explore the roles played by these mysterious beings within Japanese culture and will also learn of their abundance and variety through detailed entries, some with original illustrations, on more than fifty individual creatures. The Book of Yokai provides a lively excursion into Japanese folklore and its ever-expanding influence within global popular culture. It invites readers to examine how people create, transmit, and collect folklore, and how they make sense of the mysteries in the world around them. By exploring yokai as a concept, we can better understand broader processes of tradition, innovation, storytelling, and individual and communal creativity"--Provided by publisher},

Twelve essays explore Zelda's mythmaking from the standpoints of literary criticism, videogame theory, musicology, ecocriticism, pedagogy, and more.},

It begins with a reminder that images are not na\"ive, followed by a brief review of the literature about the modernist ideological charge of two types of images widely used in games: maps and perspective projections. Considerations about the mediating role of game images leads to the hypothesis that games highlight the inseparability of the spatial practices known as mapping and touring (de Certeau 1984; Lammes 2008, 2009, 2015, 2018). The ideas are exemplified by the combined uses of maps and perspective images in 5 games. Results indicate that maps and central perspective reify Modern values and beliefs. They are more likely to challenge the stratification of spatial practices when encountered in combination or in intermediate forms such as oblique projections. Their potential is intensified by synchronicity and by releasing control of the point of view.},

Although the HRO literature identifies a number of hallmarks of reliability, less attention is paid to how mindfulness is operationally achieved in situ by individuals on the frontline working in HROs. This study addresses this gap using a multiphase, multimethod investigation of US Navy SEALs, identifying new links between individual mindfulness attributes (comfort with uncertainty and chaos) and collective mindfulness influences (a positive orientation towards failure) that combine to co-create a phenomenon we call ``mindfulness in action.'' Mindfulness in action occurs when HROs achieve an attentive yet flexible focus capable of incorporating multiple---sometimes competing---realities to assess alternative solutions and take action in dynamic situations. By providing a more nuanced conceptualization of the links between individual mindfulness attributes and collective mindfulness influences, this paper opens up new avenues of discovery for a wide range of reliability-seeking organizations.

  abstract = {Heroism as an expression of self-actualization and a pinnacle social state is of fundamental interest to humanistic psychology and the field more broadly. This review places the growing discussion on heroic action in a humanistic perspective, as heroism aligns with ethical self-actualization in its highest form, personal meaning making, and social good, and can also involve profound existential costs. This review is organized in four major sections: First, the historical and philosophical underpinnings of heroism are examined, moving from ancient Greco-Roman perspectives, to more modern interpretations of Continental philosophy, and to Freud and Le Bon. Second, the article summarizes in detail a renaissance of interest in the psychology of heroism that began in the early 2000s, moving from a modern re-theorizing of heroism toward empirical exploration. This renewal of interest is described as six overlapping phases: theory building and exploration of operational definitions of heroism, taxonometric approaches to heroic figures, implicit theories of heroism, social ascription of heroic status, social influence of heroes, and internal motivations for heroic action. Third, key methodological challenges in studying heroism are discussed. Finally, the renewed interest in heroism is considered as a social movement involving not just researchers but also the broader public.},

  abstract = {Video games that customize to a player's experience level and abilities have the potential to allow a broader range of players to become engaged and maintain interest as they progress in experience level. A game that uniquely customizes the player's experience could attract additional demographics to gaming, which will result in a distinct edge in marketability and potential revenue. This thesis examines a subsection of adaptive gaming systems from the perspective of identifying game factors that alter the level of difficulty. Our focus is to provide a solution useful to both research and commercial gaming communities by developing a system that simulates results offline yet can be integrated into online play. While online performance is the main goal of an adaptive system, the offline simulation provides several benefits. Offline simulation allows the elimination of insignificant factors from inclusion in the training and evolution phase of machine learning algorithms. In addition it provides commercial games with a useful tool or method for performing game balancing and level tuning. To test our approach we designed a test-bed version of the game Pac-Man. The experimental testbed alters environment variables to evaluate their effect on a set of selected response variables. Observing the results of several response variables provides the potential to represent multiple player states, though our focus is on controlling the difficulty for a player. The testbed will simulate the actions of both Pac-Man and the ghosts over a variety of different settings and strategies. The evaluation of a factor's significance and its effect size are calculated using a factorial analysis approach. This method allows the identification of factors relevant to both individual strategies, and the set of all player strategies. Finally, as a proof of concept for both the online and adaptation prospects of this method, we developed a prototype adaptive system. Utilizing the relevant factor effects calculated in the factorial analysis, the prototype adapts to control the progress of the game towards targeted response variable intervals.},

It examines underlying reasons and places this phenomenon within the wider context of modern uses of runes as symbols instead of an alphabetic writing system. The modern political use of runes across Europe differs between countries, partly due to different legal provisions, but as this chapter shows, there are also roots in 19th- and 20th-century history.},

The discussion ties together heroism and fundamental sociological debates about the relationship between the individual and the social order; it elucidates the socio-psychological, cultural/ideational and socio-political structuring of heroism, which challenges the tendency to understand people, actions and events as naturally, or intrinsically, heroic; and it points to a theoretical trajectory within the literature, which has moved from very exclusive to more inclusive conceptualisations of a hero. After this discussion, the article examines three problematic areas in the sociology of heroism: the underlying masculine character of heroism; the presumed disappearance of the hero with modernisation; and the principal idea of heroism as a pro-social phenomenon. The article calls for a more self-conscious engagement with this legacy, which could stimulate dialogue across different areas of sociological research.},

  abstract = {This article introduces an approach to ideologies of texts and of categories of text type for approaching the emic conceptions of things made of language or other kinds of signs. Finno-Karelian incantations of the ritual specialist known as a tiet\"aj\"a provide a case study, considered in the broader context of cultures in the CircumBaltic region. Text ideology is salient in this tradition owing to a conception that a performer will lose an incantation's power when it is communicated as a whole to someone else, but not if verses are omitted. Discussion is organized in four parts, providing different types of contextualization before discussing emic conceptions of incantations proper. It begins with a theoretical introduction to text ideologies and genre ideologies in relation to language ideologies. This section includes positioning the approach from the perspective of (Finnish) folklore studies for better multidisciplinary accessibility. The second section contextualizes the tiet\"aj\"a as a social institution, the corpora and approach. The third section introduces the ritual technology of the tiet\"aj\"a, the physics of the world in which these operate and what these are conceived as `doing' in ritual performance. The fourth section turns to the understanding of incantations as a type of text object in relation to the technology and their variation in practice.},

  abstract = {Myth has become a fundamental frame of reference for Western thinking. This paper explores the term and category ``myth'' from the perspective of folklore studies, with concern for the use of myth as a tool in research. The ways in which myth has been used in both academic and popular discourses are discussed. These are viewed in a historical perspective against the backdrop of the origins of the modern term. Attention is given to how historical patterns of use have encoded ``myth'' with evaluative stance-taking, building an opposition of ``us'' versus ``them'' into myth as something ``other people'' have, in contrast to us, who know better. Discussion then turns to approaching myth as a type of story. The consequences of such a definition are explored in terms of what it does or does not include; the question of whether, as has often been supposed, myth is a text-type genre, is also considered. Discussion advances to aesthetic evaluation at the root of modern discussions of myth and how this background informs the inclination to identify myth as a type of story on the one hand while inhibiting the extension of the concept to, for example, historical events or theories about the world or its origins, on the other. Approaching myth as a type of modeling system is briefly reviewed---an approach that can be coupled to viewing myth as a type of story. Finally, discussion turns to the more recent trend of approaching mythology through mythic discourse, and the consequences as well as the benefits of such an approach for understanding myth in society or religion. There are many different ways to define myth. The present article explores how different approaches are linked to one another and have been shaped over time, how our definition of myth and the way we frame the concept shape our thinking, and can, in remarkably subtle ways, inhibit the reflexive application of the concept as a tool to better understand ourselves.},

It is argued that all three were likely conceived as having distinct body images linked to the respective ritual technologies that they used. Bringing into focus the relationship between the technology of practice and body image interfaced with it offers insights into how their technologies were imagined to ``work'', and also the degree to which they aligned with or diverged from the normative body image identified with non-specialists in society. A response to the chapter has been submitted by Margaret Clunies Ross.},

We show that the canon is far more varied than previously suggested and demonstrate ways that it has changed over time. The article's research implications include explicating different functions of game citation as well as providing an empirical basis for identifying under-researched games. Our findings also identify the games with which familiarity is most important to understand existing research. Finally, we propose ways the game studies canon can help address pedagogical, technological, and legal obstacles to the development of game studies as a discipline.},

These case studies look at some of the core aspects of four major titles (The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn, various BioWare games and Journey) and survey how these games work to effectively employ a narrative while maintaining an immersive, intuitive system for the player to interact with. Through these titles, the thesis suggests that in order to gain a full scope of a game's intentions, studies should analyze more than the base story or gameplay, but rather the correlations between them as well as the ways that the visuals and audio aspects interact and enhance the narrative. Furthermore, it suggests the importance of creating gameplay that works with the story in order to ensure that the player always feels as though they have a stake in the outcome of the game, regardless of the nature of the narrative.},

Golden-age descriptions of nostalgia that are of particular interest were derived from the observation of conscript soldiers in Napoleonic campaigns by authors such as Gerbois and Larrey. In 1909 Jaspers devoted his doctoral thesis to this topic (Nostalgia und Verbrechen). From a cultural history point of view, it could be considered today as an example of `transient illness'. The nosological relay has taken place through clinical pictures such as the pathology associated with exile, forced displacements and psychosis of captivity.},

The analysis of 34 European shirt movements reveals some common features in terms of colour, ideology and chronology. Most of them were consistent with the logic and imagery of interwar totalitarianisms, which emerged as an alleged alternative to the decaying bourgeois society and its main political creation: the Parliamentary system. Unlike liberal pluralism and its institutional expression, shirt movements embody the idea of a homogeneous community, based on a racial, social or cultural identity, and defend the streets, not the ballot boxes, as a new source of legitimacy. They perfectly mirror the overwhelming presence of the ``brutalization of politics'' (Mosse) and ``senso-propaganda'' (Chakhotin) in interwar Europe.},

This paper introduces "1001 Nights", a co-creative story-crafting game that transforms writing into a playful and rewarding activity. In this game, the AI agent takes on the role of a "moody" king with distinct storytelling preferences, not merely assisting but actively influencing the narrative. Players engage with the king agent through strategic storytelling, guiding him to mention weapon-related keywords, which materialize as battle equipment. The king agent provides dynamic feedback, expressing satisfaction or displeasure, prompting players to adjust their approach. By combining storytelling, game mechanics, and AI-driven responses, our system motivates creativity through playful constraints. Inspired by Oulipo's literary techniques, this approach demonstrates how AI-powered game experiences can make creative writing more accessible and engaging, encouraging players to explore their creative potential.},

These included casual games (i.e., puzzle and Kart Racing), hard core games (i.e., 1st person shooter, action-adventure and role-playing) and real world games (i.e., music and sports). It was found that while the casual genre's had the least presence overall they were no different in self reported absorption or game satisfaction than the other two genre types. Sociability was highest in the hard core game genre types as was the realism of 3D effects. Finally, the real world genre were most characterized by the perceived sense of similarity to the real world, thus the label.},

Building bridges between the humanities approach to Game Studies, American Studies, International Relations and Critical Geopolitics, we start from the assumption that digital games are more than ``kid's games''; they are sophisticated vehicles inhabiting and disseminating specific ideologies (Leonard 2004). Accordingly, our goal is to conduct a content analysis (Sisler 2008) of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 to show how these games contain images and narratives that (1) resonate with and reinforce a tabloid imaginary of post-9/11 geopolitics (Debrix 2008); (2) glorify military power and elicit consent for the idea that state violence and wars are inevitable; and (3) encourage our myopia by depicting a sanitized vision of war and downplaying the negative consequences of state violence (Stahl 2006). The conclusion invites players to think about ways to criticize the way games like Call of Duty employ and deploy values that (re)write the militarist mindset that has often pervaded the post-9/11 U.S. national security debate.},

  abstract = {The relevance of studying mythological structures in video games is due, on one hand, for the development of game studies, on the other hand, for the process of modern culture digitalization, in which myth acquires special significance explained by the blurring of real and virtual boundaries. We understand myth as a significant cultural reality associated with an existential human need for understanding and structuring reality, shaping a picture of the world and determining a person's place in it, constructing identity, social order and value-semantic foundations of one's own existence. A modern person exists under the influence of many dissimilar mythological constructs. Today, media mythologize reality, fix key media images in the minds of the audience, reproduce mythologemes and archetypes. Video games as interactive media are more capable than old media to immerse a person into the space of myth. We explore video games as a form of modern mythology. The purpose of this article is to study such universal mythological structures as archetypes and how they are represented in video games (using games in fantasy, action and adventure genres as an example). In the process of research, we rely on the archetypes proposed by C. Vogler: hero, mentor, threshold guardian, herald, shapeshifter, shadow, trickster, ally, since most of the images encountered in the hero's journey belong to these archetypes. The main results of the research: it was revealed that, firstly, the hero's archetype is the foundation of any plot-oriented video game; secondly, monomyth in video games is reduced: the initial and final stages of monomyth are usually omitted; thirdly, the image of the hero in video games has similar characteristics with the image of the mythological hero; fourthly, all archetypes are represented in the video games studied, and the archetype of the threshold guardian, the ally, and the shadow are the most common of them. We have concluded that the archetypes as archaic mythological structures and universals of the collective unconscious are fully represented and function in the figurative system of video games. This confirms that archaic mythological semantics does not disappear; myth and archetypes continue to be present and function in modern culture, covered with new clothes of interactive media. Despite the fact that video games feature fictional virtual worlds, they are fully capable of providing cathartic experiences to players. Moreover, it is video games where a player becomes not only an observer, but also a performer of a hero's journey, which leads to spiritual transformation.},

  abstract = {This  article  refers  to  the  philosophical  study  of  myth  construction  in  videogames.  We  have  studied  how  the  philosophical  ideas  of  the  Modern  Era  (which  has  the  idea  of  rationalization  in  its  core)  were  presented  in  videogames  using  horror  games  as examples. We have analyzed the narrative of Modernization as ``disenchantment of the  world''  (M.  Weber)  in  several  game  series  ( Outlast,  The  Evil  Within ,  Resident  Evil ). Eventually,  we  have  concluded  that  the  narration  in  these  games  is  constructed  in  accor dance with  a certain scheme:  a) supernatural powers  are set  in action, b)  a player  discovers  their  real  essence -- they  are  the  product  of  scientific  experiments.  Thus,  mystical,  supernatural  and  religious  objects  appear  to  be  merely  illusions ,  but  the  obje cts   of   science   are   proclaimed   to   really   exist.  We   claim   therefore   that  the  ``disenchantment of the world'' myth functions in these games.  Basing on videogames as  a phenomenon of modern culture we show how the ideas and the culture of the Modern  Era accepting science as the only possible source of the truth continue to exist today.

An interactive autobiography about a young woman sharing her life online, Cibele explores the terms on which new media enable users to narrate their experiences, represent themselves and forge identities. This article locates the game in relation to recent developments in life writing and independent game design, asking what digital technologies offer autobiographers as medium and as subject matter. It also frames Cibele as an attempt to challenge two dominant discourses about online culture: offering a counterpoint to narratives stressing the dangers facing young women who seek intimacy on the internet, Cibele also questions framings of networked intimacy as a necessarily deficient substitute for ``the real thing.'' Its oblique approach, however, in tandem with its commitment to witnessing the ambivalences and incoherencies of digital culture, have, I argue, led to these points being missed or misinterpreted by players, reflecting a longstanding tendency to dismiss and devalue women's life writing.},

It argues that Bethesda's stewardship of the franchise over the course of its twenty year history has been characterised less by an unwavering creative vision than a willingness to make use of the resources to hand - not least the inventiveness of modding communities. Charting how Bethesda employees and the games' modders have performed and discussed their respective roles, we track shifts in the tools, vocabularies, aims and approaches of both parties. We find that while the practices and priorities of modders and developers have, in many respects, converged over this period, crucial legal and conceptual distinctions continue to separate professionals from amateurs. Valve's abortive attempt to introduce paid mods to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim threw this division into stark relief, emphasising the need for studies of modding which address the performativity of intellectual property, showing how conceptions of authorship and ownership develop over time within specific studios, cultures and publics.},

By re-building obsolete technology using today's software, the past comes to light in new ways, from intricate algebraic patterns woven on a hand loom, to striking artificial-life simulations, to war games and back boxes. A description of the past, this book is also an assessment of all that remains uncomputable as we continue to live in the aftermath of the long digital age},

Many well-known games allow players to enjoy a series of events intrinsically connected to plot and machinations based on famous names in literature. Recently, Lovecraftian literature has been on the rise, as many different games are being based on its storyworld. This article investigates the manifestations of Gothic literature and, more specifically, Beyond the Wall of Sleep (1919) by H.P. Lovecraft in Bloodborne (2015) from Fromsoftware studios. We intend to identify and interpret the adaptations of literary content in this game in order to analyse typical traits of the Lovecraftian style and show how they might be adapted to a video game scenario. This paper also aims to make a brief contribution regarding the use of imagetic resources that intensify, mitigate and reshape the literary scenarios in digital game media. Furthermore, this study aims to acknowledge which types of images are chosen and how it may be related to Gothic fiction. We argue that, in Bloodborne, the settings, the abjection, the Gothic horror, and the destabilization of the natural order all validate it as a Lovecraftian game.},

A quantitative survey was distributed online among users of the three case studies (n:387 participants). Instrument items included playing habits, sameness and selfhood and the triggering gaming traits. Results. Specific categories of features are able to foster selfhood and sameness experiences with various outcomes in terms of the subjects' satisfaction, interpretation and autonomy. Conclusions. Implications of the study are noteworthy for a) practitioners interested in deepening time routines in games through an audiences' lens and b) researchers, who may take inspiration to stress and expand the topic with further focuses and research designs.},

  abstract = {Otome games is a category of games originated in Japan that are marketed specifically to women. While genres in this particular category tend to range from RPGs to visual novels (the latter being the most common), they notably have the following common features: these games contain a system that allows the female player character to form relationships with the mostly straight and predominantly male game characters, they have simple controls, and they are related to other multimedia products, often imitating plots and art styles from manga and anime. Moreover, romance is often features as a part the games' narratives, often imitating plots from shoujo manga. Although otome games occupy a niche sector of the game industry in its country of origin, the number of titles that are being adapted for audiences outside of Japan have steadily increased during the past decade. This thesis explores this largely unexplored category of games, its players and the ways in which these titles have migrated out of Japan. Focusing on games, platforms and its predominantly female fandom, I examine cultural sensibilities, economies and online social formations that allow these migrations to happen. I apply a mixed-methods approach of textual analysis and interviews to help formulate my analysis of these games and the fan communities, which operate quite similarly to Radway's book clubs. The results of this study indicate how communities and postfeminist media cultures both allow women to shape discourses around gender and romance, but also at the same time limit these discourses in ways that are beneficial to companies that create and localize these games.},

  abstract = {The procedural generation of massive subplots and backstories in secondary characters that inhabit OpenWorld videogames usually lead to stereotyped characters that act as a mere backdrop for the virtual world; however, many game designers claim that the stories can be very relevant for the player's experience. For this reason we are looking for a methodology that improves the variability of the characters' personality while enhancing the quality of their backstories following artistic or literary guidelines. In previous works, we used multi agent systems in order to obtain stochastic, but regulated, inter-relations that became backstories; later, we have used genetic algorithms to promote the appearance of high level behaviors inside them. Our current work continues the previous research line and propose a three layered system (Evolutionary computation - Agent-Based Model - Logical Reasoner) that is applied to the promotion of the monomyth, commonly known as the hero's journey, a social pattern that constantly appears in literature, films, and videogames. As far as we know, there is no previous attempt to model the monomyth as a logical theory, and no attempt to use the sub-solutions for narrating purposes. Moreover, this paper shows for the first time this multi-paradigm three-layeredmethodology to generate massive backstories. Different metrics have been tested in the experimental phase, from those that sum all the monomyth-related tropes to those that promote distribution of archetypes in the characters. Results confirm that the system canmake the monomyth emerge and that the metric has to take into account facilitator predicates in order to guide the evolutionary process. \copyright{} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

  abstract = {This paper is an attempt to explicate the concept of ``independent game'' and its relation to the concept of ``indie game''. We claim that, despite the etymology, the term ``indie'' is not just an abbreviation of the term ``independent''. In fact, it should be understood as a distinct historical notion within the wider concept of ``independent'' video game. Our argument is inspired by the works of Reinhart Koselleck (2002) on conceptual history and applies explication - introduced in analytical philosophy by Rudolf Carnap (1950) - as a methodological tool. We argue that the concept of ``independent game'' can be explained as a disjunction of three types of independence. These three types of independence can be defined as a relation between the game and a respective external factor. We distinguish between (A) financial independence (constituted by the developer -- investor relation), (B) creative independence (developer -- intended audience) and (C) publishing independence (developer -- publisher). Although the definition we propose is disjunctive, all of its three disjuncts (A, B and C) remain functionally similar (they all represent an independence from something). None of these disjuncts taken in isolation presents a necessary condition for game independence but the whole disjunction can be treated as such. Moreover, in a particular time period, the properties described above become highly correlated with a set of contingent properties (e.g. digital distribution, retro style or small team) determined by cultural, social, economic and technological circumstances of the video game culture of the era. As these contingent properties are oftentimes much easier to recognize  (e.g. retro style) then the details of financial, creative and publishing situation of a game, they become heavily associated with independent games produced in a given time and place. We believe that the term ``indie game'' refers simply to a set of contingent properties - ``indie markers'' - correlated with a specific kind of independent games that has emerged around the mid-2000s in the Western world.},

The former manifests itself in `total restoration of monuments of the past', while the latter `lingers in the dreams of another place and another time'. Restorative nostalgia is visible in the retrogaming practices, such as creation of emulators, appreciation of classic titles and remaking them for new platforms. Reflective nostalgia is more detached from the past and sees history of the medium as a set of styles, it serves creativity and artistic erudition. In the article I elaborate on the nostalgic gestures of independent game designers in games such as Hotline Miami, Fez, FTL: Faster than light and McPixel. I argue that retro games are an exceedingly heterogeneous group with different authors having different objectives and motivations.},

According to the myth, a human can be conceived in two different ways: like a fragile animal or like an animal close to divinity. Despite the antiquity of the myth, we can perceive that these two visions of the human being are present in the discussion that we are trying to explain. In fact, the interventionists think that human beings have culture and for that reason they have to intervene in the relations between animals and environment. On the contrary, the advocates of non-intervention, either good or bad, think that human beings are equal to the other animals and for that reason they must not impose their wishes, and not only that, they also think that they have not enough intelligence to manipulate nature for the sake of animals nor of the ecosystem.},

Its topical diagnosis on the Zeitgeist of a ``new obscurity in style'' embraces the political framework of the Frankfurt School in terms of shared positions and conceptions in the historical development of the New Right in Europe and North America that presently reinforce the dogma of the cultural revolution of the right. Accordingly, this critical study dissects the rise and the rhetoric of far-right fashion brands, the weaponization of AI fashion technology, as well as the infiltration by extreme-right networks of (digital) media discourses and contemporary theories on culture and fashion. From the alt-right faction to deliberately produced confusion, to downplaying the harms and normalization of a racist, white-supremacist, anti-immigration, nation-first militarist agenda, to the role of the fashion designer as a far-right activist, to the implementation of fashion profiling technologies in the extent of cyber warfare, the paper reveals the different political strategies underlying the new obscurity in style. In conclusion, it examines the concept of metapolitics as the dominant scheme behind the far right's weaponization of fashion and fashion technologies.},

It is one of the few examples of global messages of mass culture being based on Polish creativity. The recognition of ``The Witcher'', due to the Netflix production, soon contributed to building the national pride of Polish people, and at the same time sparked a discussion in Central and Eastern European countries on the consequences of the multimedia adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski's prose. Questions about the dissonance between the Slavic and universal dimensions of ``The Witcher'' in relation to the original novels and their adaptations are a part of the traditional discourse on the adaptability of literature and its consequences for the reception by the audience. This article tries to capture the specific character of the adaptations of Andrzej Sapkowski's literature from the point of view of typology, known from the literature of the subject, as well as to answer the question about the consequences of the discrepancy between the original book and its adaptations in the form of a film, a TV series, and computer games. The considerations in the article were based on the literature analysis and the research based on the existing sources.},

These concepts link to the avatarial display and avatarial presence of a game character and emphasise how the various 'positions' effect our movements and experience within the game world, and help us understand how we, as players, are 'performing' through our avatars, engaging in and enjoying a player-{$>$}controller-{$>$}avatar experience that is essentially aesthetic and emotional.},

Ritual will be understood through the idea of a ``ritual logic'' that enables the wider associations of ritual in the virtual as opposed to the real world to be analyzed, and through the key element of repetition in game play. In part derived from the intertextuality of video game genres and associated popular culture artifacts such as films and novels, ritual logic contributes to the players' knowledge and understanding of what ritual is and what ritual does in the game, and how ritual can be used to progress its narrative and play trajectories.},

Its central presuppositions are (1) that there are certain attributes broadly understood as ``GS'' by those writing in or adjacent to the field; (2) that those attributes are historically rooted in an attempt to disassociate videogames from other types of electronic (and later---digital) media; and that (3) the preconditions that have led to this split are currently moot. In the first section of this article, I elaborate on these presuppositions through reading GS as a historically rooted field, centred around the videogame artefact. Following, by examining the notion of being `against' something in academic work, I move to my central claim for the article: that maintaining this conception of GS is counterproductive to the state of contemporary videogames scholarship and that adopting a post-dualistic and post-humanities stance will greatly contribute to the broadening of the field. I break down this claim into three separate threads. Ontologically, I show that videogames are much closer to non-videogames than they used to be. Methodologically, I point out how re-integrating methodologies from outside the field is crucial to address the complex phenomena evolved in and around gaming. Politically, I highlight the importance of games in contemporary digital culture and show how boundary-work and gatekeeping might harm the attempt to make game scholarship engage with larger political issues. The article concludes with suggestions for a more inclusive and intermingled vision for the field, focusing on the notion of play rather than games.},

  abstract = {In digital games, the player's activity often includes a necessary repetition to achieve an appropriate knowledge of the game's mechanics and dynamics. This process can involve various failures of the player. Even if a digital game can be theoretically completed without failures, the player must practically learn from every mistake, which often corresponds to the death of the main character. Every avatar constantly lives in a vulnerable existence that includes its death during the gameplay. If a character can be vulnerable, the player can be inadequate, but digital games always provide a chance of redemption, and a failure becomes a necessary step on the path to further growth. On the basis of various Italian and other international scientific contributions on the themes of failure and death in digital games, the following essay will analyse two different case studies: Dead Cells and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In these titles, death is not only a necessary part of the gameplay, but it also becomes a focal concept of the storytelling thanks to two different principles which will underline specific modes to emphasize the narrative importance of death and failure in the digital game medium.},

Can they live and change as humans do? Can NPCs have personalities, and can these develop through interactions with players, other NPCs, and the world around them? Despite advances in personality AI for games, most NPCs are still undeveloped and undeveloping, reacting with flat affect and predictable routines that make them far less than human--in fact, they become little more than bits of the scenery that give out parcels of information. This need not be the case. Extreme AI, a psychology-based personality engine, creates adaptive NPC personalities. Originally developed as part of the thesis "NPCs as People: Using Databases and Behaviour Trees to Give Non-Player Characters Personality," Extreme AI is now a fully functioning personality engine using all thirty facets of the Five Factor model of personality and an AI system that is live throughout gameplay. This paper discusses the research leading to Extreme AI; develops the ideas found in that thesis; discusses the development of other personality engines; and provides examples of Extreme AI's use in two game demos.},

  abstract = {Technology trees are evolutionary tree diagrams that simulate the progress of technology in historical strategy games in a deterministic manner. Having the double function of representing the history of technology while being a core mechanism in the game itself, the tech tree plays an important role in the overall game design. This article covers the question of how the tech tree determines the possibilities for representing the history of technology in historical strategy games, using the concept of technology determinism. In doing so it tries to bridge the fields of STS and game studies. I discuss and compare four important games in the genre (Age of Empires, Empire Earth, Rise of Nations and Civilization IV); and present insights from interviews with the lead designer of each game. Tech trees come in the shape of linear upgrade paths or interlocking vines structures, and fulfill various strategic and narrative functions in the games. Technological determinism is present in tech trees under three forms: by forcing a set sequence, by influencing social changes in history and by characterising (thus determining) eras and civilizations. On the level of individual technologies it becomes clear that besides the broad concept of technology, there is a lot of freedom in how the tech trees are filled in. Both the selection of technologies and the effects attributed to them are different in all four games, which makes four interesting case studies possible. The conclusion explains how tech trees determine the design of technological history in a general way, but that there are many ways for both designers and players to interpret history in their own way.},

He then turns his gaze to events in the East, where even the achievements of the Byzantine emperor Justinian and the campaigns of the brilliant military leader Belisarius could not conceal the fundamental weaknesses of their empire.},

  abstract = {In this special issue on ludic economies, we argue that the study of digital games---their milieux of production, cultures and contexts of play, user-generated production, and spectatorship should be applied as a primary heuristic in understanding the cultural economy of neoliberal late capitalism---as well as vice versa. The articles here focus on a range of issues related to both mainstream profit models including digital distribution platforms and mobile games as well as peripheral game economies such as jams and indie production. Each of the studies share an attunement to the tensions and contradictions embedded within what are commonly approached as matter-of-fact within traditional economic analysis of games. Rather than framing industrial changes as necessarily either overdetermined exploitation (of workers in the mainstream games industry, players and their `free' labour) or emancipatory and progressive (new forms of creative production, play, resistance), they address the specificity and peculiarity of game economies at both the micro- and macro-levels of industry, technology, and everyday play culture. And rather than simply countering a pessimistic picture with other, more progressive examples of contemporary game culture such as `games for change', art practices and political interventions---as important as these are---the contributions to this special issue instead track the contradictions and tensions within game cultures and economies as reflections of those within the late capitalist and patriarchal cultural economy at large.},

  abstract = {The question, the Fragestellung, which drives this paper is, can football video-games be analyzed from a religious perspective? We can answer positively, at least, provisionally. First, in order to demonstrate our approach, we will take into account the different conceptions on play drawn along sociological theories. Second, we will analyze Francis M. Cornford\&rsquo;s contribution to the already forgotten but essential work by Jane Ellen Harrison, Themis: The Social Origins of the Greek Religion, in which he established an elective affinity between the origin of the Olympic Games and the annual ritual dedicated to the Daimon-God Dionysus, in which he was elected the best Kouros (Young hero-King) of the year. At the very beginning, play, ritual, and competitive games (helped by self-reflexivity as well as collective reflexivity) were united, and that constellation is still there in modern times with the creation of modern sport. Third, in modern advanced societies the football game-sport creates meaning, and succeeded throughout two main processes such as the sportification and progressive rationalization of violence. Fourth, we built an ideal type of two competing strategies, in which created a new type of hero, the sports hero, the modern celebrity. Finally, fifth, we analyze how in our digitalized societies the football videogames are a sort of play on the play of which comes out a religious transcendence associated with it, \&ldquo;Throughout the videogame I become myself in my idol\&rdquo;. We explain this comparing two ideal types, the Dionysian-Messi versus the Apollonian-Ronaldo.},

  address = {Chicago, IL},
  abstract = {While the 1950s have been popularly portrayed-on television and in the movies and literature-as a conformist and conservative age, the decade is better understood as a revolutionary time for politics, economy, mass media, and family life. Magazines, films, newspapers, and television of the day scrutinized every aspect of this changing society, paying special attention to the lifestyles of the middle-class men and their families who were moving to the suburbs newly springing up outside American cities. Much of this attention focused on issues of masculinity, both to enforce accepted ideas and to understand serious departures from the norm. Neither a period of "male crisis" nor yet a time of free experimentation, the decade was marked by contradiction and a wide spectrum of role models. This was, in short, the age of Tennessee Williams as well as John Wayne. In Men in the Middle, James Gilbert uncovers a fascinating and extensive body of literature that confronts the problems and possibilities of expressing masculinity in the 1950s. Drawing on the biographies of men who explored manhood either in their writings or in their public personas, Gilbert examines the stories of several of the most important figures of the day-revivalist Billy Graham, playwright Tennessee Williams, sociologist David Riesman, sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, Playboy literary editor Auguste Comte Spectorsky, and TV-sitcom dad Ozzie Nelson-and allows us to see beyond the inherited stereotypes of the time. Each of these stories, in Gilbert's hands, adds crucial dimensions to our understanding of masculinity the 1950s. No longer will this era be seen solely in terms of the conformist man in the gray flannel suit or the Marlboro Man.},

The relationship between these two media is layered and they are interconnected not only through their textual fabric (sharing and influencing each other in form and contents), but also in their practices and the theories that accompany them. More than fifteen years ago, in a seminal piece published on Film Quarterly, Mark J. P. Wolf pointed at the relationship between cinema and video games beyond `characters and plotlines' (1997, p. 11), including aesthetics, visual codes, iconographies, practices, social spaces. The connection between video games and cinema (and, more broadly, the tradition of audiovisual media) is conceptually reflected by the compound noun that gives the name to the medium 1, but the two also show similar production models, sharing professional figures and displaying familiar consumption behaviours.},

  abstract = {During its first decade, Game Studies debate mainly revolved around the juxtaposition between two perspectives: the one of ludology and the one of narratology, each positing a primary quality of video games against the other. The study of the relationship between cinema and video games got somehow caught in the crossfire between these two fields. In this work, I investigate the extent to which representation in video games is connected to cinema and its representational codes. A number of authors before challenged this assumption, theorising models that only partially connect the cinematic form to video games. Such investigations have always started from the ludologically educated assumption that video games are different from cinema and, therefore, for the premises of this comparison to be considered ``vitiated'', only tangentially useful due to the irreconcilably different nature of the two media. The adjective ``cinematic'' is a concept constantly evoked in cultural discourses concerning video games. Magazines, reviewers, critics, but also designers, artists, users and commentators (even scholars) often summon the idea of cinematic games in the attempt of describing some peculiar features that share affinities with films and suggesting that video games possess the aura of the big screen. Cinematic games are born at the crossroads between interactive movies and video games, for which the cinematic expression is retained by means of audiovisual representation while keeping the action in the hands of the player. Due to the vast scale of the subject, my work focuses on relatively recent developments in game design which have yet to be fully investigated, and seeks to extend existing attempts to apply the tools of film theory to Game Studies. A secondary value of this work is an annotation on the disengagement of moving image scholars with video games, and it partly serves as an invocation for this to change.},

This will be done with an interdisciplinary case analysis of Brothers: a tales of two sons and Papers, Please. My goals are two. The first one is to offer a deeper perspective on how complex contents, like brotherhood as a value and migration as a topic, dramatically depend on the cognitions triggered by playing that act as signifiers for interpretations on all the different layers of meaning.

  abstract = {In recent years, the field of Memory Studies has emerged as a key approach in the Humanities and Social Sciences, and has increasingly shown its ability to open new windows on Nordic Studies as well. The entries in this book document the work-to-date of this approach on the pre-modern Nordic world (mainly the Viking Age and the Middle Ages, but including as well both earlier and later periods). Given that Memory Studies is an ever expanding critical strategy, the approximately eighty contributors in this volume also discuss the potential for future research in this area. Topics covered range from texts to performance to visual and other aspects of material culture, all approached from within an interdisciplinary framework. International specialists, coming from such relevant fields as archaeology, mythology, history of religion, folklore, history, law, art, literature, philology, language, and mediality, offer assessments on the relevance of Memory Studies to their disciplines and show it at work in case studies. Finally, this handbook demonstrates the various levels of culture where memory had a critical impact in the pre-modern North and how deeply embedded the role of memory is in the material itself.},

  abstract = {Selective sustained attention, or the ability to allocate perceptual and mental resources to a single object or event, is an important cognitive ability widely assumed to be required for learning. Assessing young children's selective sustained attention is challenging due to the limited number of sensitive and developmentally appropriate performance-based measures. Furthermore, administration of existing assessments is difficult, as children's engagement with such tasks wanes quickly. One potential solution is to provide assessments within an engaging environment, such as a video game. This paper reports the design and psychometric validation of a video game (Monster Mischief) designed to assess selective sustained attention in preschool children. In a randomized controlled trial, the authors demonstrate that Monster Mischief is significantly correlated with an existing measure of selective sustained attention (rs = 0.52), and more motivating for young children as almost 3 times more children preferred Monster Mischief to the existing measure.},

Conceiving of the wish to dwell within the game as a longing for radical alterity serves as a theoretical extension of rhythmanalysis for thinking about the porous boundaries of the game text. The article seeks to expand the established discursive and conceptual function accorded to stillness as a form of play. It discusses three `nostalgic gestures' that stall the game's action: the glance from foreground to background; the shift from the game to paratextual materials; and the drift of attention out the window or away from the gaming context altogether. Gaming's promise of exotic transport activates a ``fervor of the possible,'' a melancholic identification with the world beyond which invests game spaces with the capacity for hopeful discovery, verging on a wish to remove oneself from the flow of time altogether.},

While expert advice may be wrong at times, nonexperts, on balance, benefit from following scientific experts rather than ignoring them. In short, the public needs science. Numerous professional codes such as the 2017 European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, scientific reports (e.g., American Association of Arts and Science. 2014. Public Trust in Vaccines: Defining a Research Agenda. https://www.amacad.org/sites/ default/files/publication/downloads/publicTrustVaccines.pdf) and academic scholarship emphasize the importance of public trust in science and recommend a variety of ways to promote it. Less attention, however, is given to the converse relation between science and the public, namely how much science needs the public. This article examines this two-way relationship by considering the role of trust in science, both within scientific communities and between science and the public, where and how public mistrust arises, and what can be done to improve public trust in science.},

  abstract = {The role of the military in Canadian society has long been an issue of debate among policy makers, academics, and citizens. Particularly since the Somalia scandal that shocked the country in the late 1990s, the Canadian military has faced challenges to repair its damaged reputation. Since that time, the Canadian Forces has focused on representing itself as an organization based on quality leadership, strong ethics, and commitment to international aid. However, as the official image of the Canadian military has been shaped, representations of the organization have been constructed in popular culture as well. Paul Gross's film Passchendaele is one such example. The award-winning film, released in 2008 amid much fanfare, is a historical fictional drama that presents the Canadian soldiers' experiences in World War One (WWI). Mixing romance in with war, this film mythologizes the role of the Canadian military and its soldiers in a number of interesting ways. One theme explored within this chapter is the way the film negotiates the presentation of a national military history in which success on the battlefield is valorized against a modern-day identity construct of Canadians as peace brokers. Utilizing rhetorical narrative analysis, this chapter examines how the construction of the Canadian soldier as a ``reluctant hero'' within Passchendaele appears to be an attempt to navigate these tensions.},

However, current methods often only modify a limited set of game features such as the difficulty of the opponents, or the availability of resources. Other approaches, such as experience-driven Procedural Content Generation (PCG), can generate complete levels with desired properties such as levels that are neither too hard nor too easy, but require many iterations. This paper presents a method that can generate and search for complete levels with a specific target difficulty in only a few trials. This advance is enabled by through an Intelligent Trial-and-Error algorithm, originally developed to allow robots to adapt quickly. Our algorithm first creates a large variety of different levels that vary across predefined dimensions such as leniency or map coverage. The performance of an AI playing agent on these maps gives a proxy for how difficult the level would be for another AI agent (e.g. one that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search instead of Greedy Tree Search); using this information, a Bayesian Optimization procedure is deployed, updating the difficulty of the prior map to reflect the ability of the agent. The approach can reliably find levels with a specific target difficulty for a variety of planning agents in only a few trials, while maintaining an understanding of their skill landscape.},

The second part of the paper will analyze the representation of thelibrary (post-reconstruction) in the videogame, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2's Act 2 (called `Ghost of Sarajevo'), in order to raise issues about the ethical challenges of the representation of a heritage site that has not only been destroyed and reconstructed, but that it is part of a national heritage.The analysis shows that there are important pressures derived from the ways in which videogames represent heritage which has gone through a process of destruction, and how videogames adapt a historical event following formal videogame conventions. The paper concludes by pointing out the benefits of studying cases such as the National and University Library in Sarajevo, as well as new avenues of research regarding the representation of contested cultural sites in videogames.},

The ways of pulling data together into a digital subject is often presented as a logic of fact, where data is equated with documentary evidence. Instead, I propose the notion of the distance in which digital subjects are produced. Indexicality comes from outside of data, whereas the regard for the thick distance becomes a mark of the form of knowledge. I conclude by arguing for a posthumanities approach that establishes the distance while allowing for different subjects to be called upon.},

We argue, that despite the problematic nature of the concept of a ``game port'' it is indispensable in context such as game analysis and game preservation. For this reason, we propose a formal classification of different game versions suitable for future use in these selected contexts.},

  abstract = {A dramatically new understanding of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolution---from the development of agriculture and cities to the origins of the state, democracy, and inequality---and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation. For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike---either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself. Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what's really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume. The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.},

Some critics argue that political debate is inherently value-laden and defies objective fact checking; I offer an alternative view highlighting the practical epistemology revealed in the newswork routines and discourse of working fact checkers. Drawing links between core concepts in the sociology of science and journalism studies, this analysis highlights how in moments of institutional unsettlement, verification relies on factual coherence, rather than straightforward correspondence. To develop this argument, I anatomize a fact check produced as a participant observer with a major national fact-checking organization.},

  abstract = {The last five years have seen a global surge in political fact-checking, reporting that specializes in debunking political misinformation. A growing occupational movement, originating in the United States but increasingly international in scope, has sought to legitimize fact-checking as unbiased journalism, to establish common standards and practices, and to secure reliable funding for this emerging genre. As a genuinely transnational professional movement which includes practitioners from multiple journalistic cultures as well as other fields, fact-checking offers a new site to consider whether and how professional journalism is meaningfully becoming globalized. This paper models a novel approach to mapping a diverse organizational landscape in terms of institutional ties to the fields of journalism, academia, and politics. Drawing on fieldwork from two international gatherings of fact-checkers, I array fact-checking outlets on a ternary graph and review their competing understandings of the mission, the target, and the practices of fact-checking. I highlight areas of convergence as well as divergence in this organizational milieu, focusing particular attention on boundaries not drawn---the willingness of professional journalists in this global movement to share jurisdictional authority with non-journalists. I conclude with suggestions for a comparative research agenda focused on this emergent area of practice.},

  abstract = {Fact-checking has a traditional meaning in journalism that relates to internal procedures for verifying facts prior to publication, as well as a newer sense denoting stories that publicly evaluate the truth of statements from politicians, journalists, or other public figures. Internal fact-checking first emerged as a distinct role in U.S. newsmagazines in the 1920s and 1930s, decades in which the objectivity norm became established among American journalists. While newspapers have not typically employed dedicated fact-checkers, the term also refers more broadly to verification routines and the professional concern with factual accuracy. Both scholars and journalists have been concerned with a decline of internal fact-checking resources and routines in the face of accelerated publishing cycles and the economic crisis faced by news organizations in many parts of the world.             External fact-checking consists of publishing an evidence-based analysis of the accuracy of a political claim, news report, or other public text. Organizations specializing in such ``political'' fact-checking have been established in scores of countries around the world since the first sites appeared in the United States in the early 2000s. These outlets may be based in established news organizations but also ``good government'' groups, universities, and other areas of civil society; practitioners generally share the broad goals of helping people become better informed and promoting fact-based public discourse. A burgeoning area of research has tried to measure the effectiveness of various kinds of external fact-checking interventions in countering misinformation and promoting accurate beliefs. This literature generally finds that fact-checking can be effective in experimental settings, though the influence of corrections is limited by the familiar mechanisms of motivated reasoning.},

  abstract = {Anyone who has spent time exploring the Internet cannot help but notice the prevalence of Neo-Paganism. This paper answers the seeming paradox of why neo-Paganism, a self-proclaimed nature religion, pervades cyberspace. What defines the social space opened up by the Internet is lack of 'presence,' the face-to-face interaction of oral communication which is generally considered necessary for the formation of authentic communities, religious or otherwise (c.f. Benjamin 1968: 217-251; Eliade 1954: 141-147; Eliade 1957: 111-113, 141-147, 164; Eliade 1978: 162; Levi-Strauss 1970: 286-298; Levinas 1985: 85-92; Ong 1967). Yet, in Benedict Anderson's terms, other media besides speech enable human beings to imagine communities which transgress the hori-zons of face-to-face interaction --- "all communities larger than primordial villages of face-to-face contact (and perhaps even those) are imagined" (1983: 15). What is unique about neo-Pagan practitioners is that they are able to imagine a religious community which is not dependent on presence. Instead of presence their Internet communities are sustained by the notion of a religious 'energy' which is created and circulated by 'personal rituals.' It is their shared 'feeling of energy' which binds them together in cyberspace, and enables them to imagine a virtual religious community. Neo-Pagans 're-enchant' the disenchanted landscape of modernity through a religious strategy whose myths are patterned on an imagined pre-Christian European religion, but whose practices revolve around the production of an affective sentiment which neo-Pagan nomenclature labels 'energy.' The 'feeling of energy' created by personal rituals is a religious strategy which employs a ritualized imagination. The ritualized imagination is the sanctification not of the content of specific creative acts, but of the act of creation itself. Hence, the religious strategies that surround neo-Paganism concentrate neither on written unifying myths, nor on a set of oral traditions, nor even on a ritual complex. Instead, what binds neo-Pagans together on the Internet, and how they overcome its lack of presence, is through the experience of the perceived sentiment that accompanies creativity itself. Methodologically, my research on the Internet religious groups and neo-Paganism was collected as a 'virtual ethnographer.' I observed four religious Usenet newsgroups --- alt.pagan, soc.religion.bahai, soc.religion.christian and soc.religion.eastern --- on the Internet between October 1, 1993 and April 1, 1994. I concentrated on 'alt.pagan,' which exists "for the discussion of paganism and Witchcraft in their various forms and traditions; for sharing ideas and ritual and completed liturgy" and "for sharing within a larger community than one might find at home." (FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions document)1 Beyond observing religious newsgroups on the Internet, I also compared the ethnographic data from alt.pagan with interactions I had with neo- Pagans at the 1993 World Parliament of Religions, especially with members of Circle --- a 'Shamanic Wiccan Church' headquartered near Madison, Wisconsin; and Covenant of The Goddess --- a Wiccan Coven headquartered in Berkeley, California.},

Adopting this framework, the article tackles the question of whether including artificial intelligences that are entitled to moral consideration in virtual environments constitutes an immoral action on the part of human creators. To address this problem, the article draws on three conceptual lenses from the philosophical branch of ethics: the problem of parenthood and procreation, the question concerning the moral status of animals, and the classical problem of evil.Using a thought experiment, the concluding section proposes a contractualist answer to the question posed in this article. The same section also emphasizes the potential need to reframe our understanding of the design of virtual environments and their future stakeholders.},

Computer glitches can also be intentionally designed to be a constitutive part of a virtual world and triggered deliberately; these types of glitches are used as expressive tools that can stimulate critical thought and make us suspicious of the stability and the validity of our world-views.},

Starting from the psychological needs and the therapeutic goals that `de-roling' techniques address in dramatherapy and psychodrama, this text provides a broader understanding of procedures and exercises that define and ease transitional experiences across cultural practices such as religious rituals and spatial design. After this introductory section, we propose a tentative answer as to why game studies and virtual world research largely ignored processes of `roling' and `de-roling' that separate the lived experience of role-play from our everyday sense of the self. The concluding sections argue that de-roling techniques are likely to become more relevant, both academically and in terms of their practical applications, with the growing diffusion of virtual technologies in social practices. The relationships we can establish with ourselves and with our surroundings in digital virtual worlds are, we argue, only partially comparable with similar occurrences in pre-digital practices of subjectification. We propose a perspective according to which the accessibility and immersive phenomenological richness of virtual reality technologies are likely to exacerbate the potentially dissociative effects of virtual reality applications. This text constitutes an initial step towards framing specific socio-technical concerns and starting a timely conversation that binds together dramatherapy, psychodrama, game studies, and the design of digital virtual worlds.},

Combining perspectives from philosophy, literary theory and game studies, this book provides the first in-depth investigation into the significance of fictional games within fictional worlds. Drawing from contemporary cinema and literature, from The Hunger Games to the science fiction of Iain M. Banks, Stefano Gualeni and Riccardo Fassone introduce five key functions that different types of imaginary games have in worldbuilding. First, fictional games can emphasize the dominant values and ideologies of the fictional society they belong to. Second, some imaginary games function in fictional worlds as critical, utopian tools, inspiring shifts in the thinking and political orientation of the fictional characters. Third, a few fictional games are conducive to the transcendence of a particular form of being, such as the overcoming of human corporeality. Fourth, imaginary games within works of fiction can deceptively blur the boundaries between the contingency of play and the irrevocable seriousness of "real life", either camouflaging life as a game or disguising a game as something with more permanent consequences. And fifth, they can function as meta-reflexive tools, suggesting critical and/or satirical perspectives on how actual games are designed, played, sold, manipulated, experienced, understood and utilized as part of our culture. With illustrations in every chapter bringing the imaginary games to life, Gualeni and Fassone creatively inspire us to consider fictional games anew: not as moments of playful reprieve in a storyline, but as significant and multi-layered expressive devices"--},

  abstract = {Can games be used to communicate theoretical knowledge that is relevant to game studies? Like conceptual works of art, some games are designed to convey intellectually significant ideas in ways that are not exclusively linguistic. Drawing from art theory, we argue that the kinds of ideas one can experience practically and firsthand through `conceptual games' can be of three kinds: socio-political, philosophical, or self-reflexive. Conceptual games that take a self-reflexive stance in particular communicate knowledge about games themselves, about their expressive conventions and their relationships to players' expectations. While the quality of being self-reflexive does not by itself grant a game the status of a theoretical contribution to game studies, there are self-reflexive games that explicitly address theories and texts in the field. Among the few existing examples of self-reflexive games that were deliberately developed as scholarly contributions to game studies, Doors (the game)(Gualeni \& Van de Mosselaer 2021) is discussed and analyzed as a particularly relevant case study.},

The alleged impossibility of formulating a complete analytical definition for what constitutes a game is perhaps the most evident symptom of that difficulty. One expression of this problem that has been entirely overlooked by academia is the scholarly practice of referencing games. This paper addresses game referencing as a practice that is implicated with- and constitutive for- the ways in which we conceptualize and assign cultural value to games. Focusing on the conceptual framing of games, on game authorship, and on the historical dimensions of both, we will discuss referencing games as an act that is inevitably political. On these premises, we will provide foundational guidelines for thinking about one's decisions concerning referencing and about the meaning and relevance of those decisions.},

This essay focuses on the use of virtual worlds as mediators, and in particular on the use of videogames to guide and encourage reflections on technical, interactive, and thematic conventions in videogame design and development.   Structurally, it is composed of two interconnected parts:    1.	In the first part of this essay I will discuss NECESSARY EVIL (http://evil.gua-le-ni.com), an ex-perimental videogame that I designed as a self-reflexive virtual artifact. With the objective of clarifying the philosophical aspirations of self-reflexive videogames -- and in order to under-stand how those aspirations can be practically pursued -- I will dissect and examine the design decisions that contributed to the qualities of NECESSARY EVIL as an example of `playable phi-losophy'.    2.	Taking off from the perspectives on self-reflexive videogames offered in the first part of the essay, the second half will focus on virtual worlds as viable mediators of philosophical thought more in general. In this section, I will argue that, both through the practice of game design and through the interactive experiences of virtual worlds, twenty-first century philosophers have the possibility to challenge the often-unquestioned understanding of written discourse as the only context in which philosophical thought can emerge and be developed.},

  abstract = {In 1999, the TV movie Shark Attack depicted an attack by mutant great white sharks on the population of Cape Town. By the time the third entry in the series, Shark Attack 3, aired in 2002, mutant great whites had lost their lustre and were replaced as antagonists with the megalodon: a giant shark originating not in any laboratory, but history, having lived from approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago. The megalodon was resurrected again in May 2021 through a trifecta of events. A video of a basking shark encounter in the Atlantic went viral on the social media platform TikTok, due to users misidentifying it as a megalodon caught on tape. At the same time a boy received publicity for finding a megalodon tooth on a beach in South Carolina on his fifth birthday (Scott). And finally, the video game Stranded Deep, in which a megalodon is featured as a major enemy, was released as one of the monthly free games on the PlayStation Plus gaming service. These examples form part of a larger trend of alleged megalodon sightings in recent years, emerging as a component of the modern resurgence of cryptozoology. In the words of Bernard Heuvelmans, the Belgian zoologist who both popularised the term and was a leading figure of the field, cryptozoology is the ``science of hidden animals'', which he further explained were more generally referred to as `unknowns', even though they are typically known to local populations---at least sufficiently so that we often indirectly know of their existence, and certain aspects of their appearance and behaviour. It would be better to call them animals `undescribed by science,' at least according to prescribed zoological rules. (1-2) In other words, a large aspect of cryptozoology as a field is taking the legendary creatures of non-Western mythology and finding materialist explanations for them compatible with Western biology. In many ways, this is a relic of the era of European imperialism, when many creatures of Africa and the Americas were ``hidden animals'' to European eyes (Dendle 200-01; Flores 557; Guimont). A major example of this is Bigfoot beliefs, a large subset of which took Native American legends about hairy wild men and attempted to prove that they were actually sightings of relict Gigantopithecus. These ``hidden animals''---Bigfoot, Nessie, the chupacabra, the glawackus---are referred to as `cryptids' by cryptozoologists (Regal 22, 81-104). Almost unique in cryptozoology, the megalodon is a cryptid based entirely on Western scientific development, and even the notion that it survives comes from standard scientific analysis (albeit analysis which was later superseded). Much like living mammoths and Bigfoot, what might be called the `megalodon as cryptid hypothesis' serves to reinforce a fairy tale of its own. It reflects the desire to believe that there are still areas of the Earth untouched enough by human destruction to sustain massive animal life (Dendle 199-200). Indeed, megalodon's continued existence would help absolve humanity for the oceanic aspect of the Sixth Extinction, by its role as an alternative apex predator; cryptozoologist Michael Goss even proposed that whales and giant squids are rare not from human causes, but precisely because megalodons are feeding on them (40). Horror scholar Michael Fuchs has pointed out that shark media, particularly the 1975 film Jaws and its 2006 video game adaptation Jaws Unleashed, are imbued with eco-politics (Fuchs 172-83). These connections, as well as the modern megalodon's surge in popularity, make it notable that none of Syfy's climate change-focused Sharknado films featured a megalodon. Despite the lack of a Megalodonado, the popular appeal of the megalodon serves as an important case study. Given its scientific origin and dynamic relationship with popular culture, I argue that the `megalodon as cryptid hypothesis' illustrates how the boundaries between `hard' science and mythology, fiction and reality, as well as `monster' and `animal', are not as firm as advocates of the Western science tradition might believe. As this essay highlights, science can be a mythology of its own, and monsters can serve as its gods of the gaps---or, in the case of megalodon, the god of the depths. Megalodon Fossils: A Short History Ancient peoples of various cultures likely viewed fossilised teeth of megalodons in the area of modern-day Syria (Mayor, First Fossil Hunters 257). Over the past 2500 years, Native American cultures in North America used megalodon teeth both as curios and cutting tools, due to their large size and serrated edges. A substantial trade in megalodon teeth fossils existed between the cultures inhabiting the areas of the Chesapeake Bay and Ohio River Valley (Lowery et al. 93-108). A 1961 study found megalodon teeth present as offerings in pre-Columbian temples across Central America, including in the Mayan city of Palenque in Mexico and Sitio Conte in Panama (de Borhegyi 273-96). But these cases led to no mythologies incorporating megalodons, in contrast to examples such as the Unktehi, a Sioux water monster of myth likely inspired by a combination of mammoth and mosasaur fossils (Mayor, First Americans 221-38).~ In early modern Europe, megalodon teeth were initially referred to as `tongue stones', due to their similarity in size and shape to human tongues---just one of many ways modern cryptozoology comes from European religious and mystical thought (Dendle 190-216). In 1605, English scholar Richard Verstegan published his book A Restitution of Decayed Intelligence in Antiquities, which included an engraving of a tongue stone, making megalodon teeth potentially the subject of the first known illustration of any fossil (Davidson 333). In Malta, from the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries, megalodon teeth, known as `St. Paul's tongue', were used as charms to ward off the evil eye, dipped into drinks suspected of being poisoned, and even ground into powder and consumed as medicine (Zammit-Maempel, ``Evil Eye'' plate III; Zammit-Maempel, ``Handbills'' 220; Freller 31-32). While megalodon teeth were valued in and of themselves, they were not incorporated into myths, or led to a belief in megalodons still being extant. Indeed, save for their size, megalodon teeth were hard to distinguish from those of living sharks, like great whites. Instead, both the identification of megalodons as a species, and the idea that they might still be alive, were notions which originated from extrapolations of the results of nineteenth and twentieth century European scientific studies. In particular, the major culprit was the famous British 1872-76 HMS Challenger expedition, which led to the establishment of oceanography as a branch of science. In 1873, Challenger recovered fossilised megalodon teeth from the South Pacific, the first recovered in the open ocean (Shuker 48; Goss 35; Roesch). In 1959, the zoologist Wladimir Tschernezky of Queen Mary College analysed the teeth recovered by the Challenger and argued (erroneously, as later seen) that the accumulation of manganese dioxide on its surface indicated that one had to have been deposited within the last 11,000 years, while another was given an age of 24,000 years (1331-32). However, these views have more recently been debunked, with megalodon extinction occurring over two million years ago at the absolute latest (Pimiento and Clements 1-5; Coleman and Huyghe 138; Roesch). Tschernezky's 1959 claim that megalodons still existed as of 9000 BCE was followed by the 1963 book Sharks and Rays of Australian Seas, a posthumous publication by ichthyologist David George Stead. Stead recounted a story told to him in 1918 by fishermen in Port Stephens, New South Wales, of an encounter with a fully white shark in the 115-300 foot range, which Stead argued was a living megalodon. That this account came from Stead was notable as he held a PhD in biology, had founded the Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia, and had debunked an earlier supposed sea monster sighting in Sydney Harbor in 1907 (45-46). The Stead account formed the backbone of cryptozoological claims for the continued existence of the megalodon, and after the book's publication, multiple reports of giant shark sightings in the Pacific from the 1920s and 1930s were retroactively associated with relict megalodons (Shuker 43, 49; Coleman and Huyghe 139-40; Goss 40-41; Roesch). A Monster of Science and Culture As I have outlined above, the `megalodon as cryptid hypothesis' had as its origin story not in Native American or African myth, but Western science: the Challenger Expedition, a London zoologist, and an Australian ichthyologist. Nor was the idea of a living megalodon necessarily outlandish; in the decades after the Challenger Expedition, a number of supposedly extinct fish species had been discovered to be anything but. In the late 1800s, the goblin shark and frilled shark, both considered `living fossils', had been found in the Pacific (Goss 34-35). In 1938, the coelacanth, also believed by Western naturalists to have been extinct for millions of years, was rediscovered (at least by Europeans) in South Africa, samples having occasionally been caught by local fishermen for centuries. The coelacanth in particular helped give scientific legitimacy to the idea, prevalent for decades by that point, that living dinosaurs---associated with a legendary creature called the mokele-mbembe---might still exist in the heart of Central Africa (Guimont). In 1976, a US Navy ship off Hawaii recovered a megamouth shark, a deep-water species completely unknown prior. All of these oceanic discoveries gave credence to the idea that the megalodon might also still survive (Coleman and Clark 66-68, 156-57; Shuker 41; Goss 35; Roesch). Indeed, Goss has noted that prior to 1938, respectable ichthyologists were more likely to believe in the continued existence of the megalodon than the coelacanth (39-40). Of course, the major reason why speculation over megalodon survival had such public resonance was completely unscientific: the already-entrenched fascination with the fact that it had been a locomotive-sized killer. This had most clearly been driven home by a 1909 display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. There, Bashford Dean, an ichthyologist at the museum, reconstructed an immense megalodon jaw, complete with actual fossil teeth. However, due to the fact that Dean assumed that all megalodon teeth were approximately the same size as the largest examples medially in the jaws, Dean's jaw was at least one third larger than the likely upper limit of megalodon size. Nevertheless, the public perception of the megalodon remained at the 80-foot length that Dean extrapolated, rather than the more realistic 55-foot length that was the likely approximate upper size (Randall 170; Shuker 47; Goss 36-39). In particular, this inaccurate size estimate became entrenched in public thought due to a famous photograph of Dean and other museum officials posing inside his reconstructed jaw---a photograph which appeared in perhaps the most famous piece of shark fiction of all time, Steven Spielberg's 1975 film Jaws. As it would turn out, the megalodon connection was itself a relic from the movie's evolutionary ancestor, Peter Benchley's novel, Jaws, from the year before. In the novel, the Woods Hole ichthyologist Matt Hooper (played by Richard Dreyfuss in the film) proposes that megalodons not only still exist, but they are the same species as great white sharks, with the smaller size of traditional great whites being due to the fact that they are simply on the small end of the megalodon size range (257-59). Benchley was reflecting on what was then the contemporary idea that megalodons likely resembled scaled-up great white sharks; something which is no longer as accepted. This was particularly notable as a number of claimed sightings stated that the alleged megalodons were larger great whites (Shuker 48-49), perhaps circuitously due to the Jaws influence. However, Goss was apparently unaware of Benchley's linkage when he noted in 1987 (incidentally the year of the fourth and final Jaws movie) that to a megalodon, ``the great white shark of Jaws would have been a stripling and perhaps a between-meals snack'' (36). The publication of the Jaws novel led to an increased interest in the megalodon amongst cryptozoologists (Coleman and Clark 154; Mullis, ``Cryptofiction'' 246). But even so, it attracted rather less attention than other cryptids. From 1982-98, Heuvelmans served as president of the International Society of Cryptozoology, whose official journal was simply titled Cryptozoology. The notion of megalodon survival was addressed only once in its pages, and that as a brief mention in a letter to the editor (Raynal 112). This was in stark contrast to the oft-discussed potential for dinosaurs, mammoths, and Neanderthals to remain alive in the present day. In 1991, prominent British cryptozoologist Karl Shuker published an article endorsing the idea of extant megalodons (46-49). But this was followed by a 1998 article by Ben S. Roesch in The Cryptozoology Review severely criticising the methodology of Shuker and others who believed in the megalodon's existence (Roesch). Writing in 1999, Loren Coleman and Jerome Clark, arguably the most prominent post-Heuvelmans cryptozoologists, were agnostic on the megalodon's survival (155). The British palaeozoologist Darren Naish, a critic of cryptozoology, has pointed out that even if Shuker and others are correct and the megalodon continues to live in deep sea crevasses, it would be distinct enough from the historical surface-dwelling megalodon to be a separate species, to which he gave the hypothetical classification Carcharocles modernicus (Naish). And even the public fascination with the megalodon has its limits: at a 24 June 2004 auction in New York City, a set of megalodon jaws went on sale for \$400,000, but were left unpurchased (Couzin 174). New Mythologies The `megalodon as cryptid hypothesis' is effectively a fairy tale born of the blending of science, mythology, and most importantly, fiction. Beyond Jaws or Shark Attack 3---and potentially having inspired the latter (Weinberg)---perhaps the key patient zero of megalodon fiction is Steve Alten's 1997 novel Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror, which went through a tortuous development adaptation process to become the 2018 film The Meg (Mullis, ``Journey'' 291-95). In the novel, the USS Nautilus, the US Navy's first nuclear submarine and now a museum ship in Connecticut, is relaunched in order to hunt down the megalodon, only to be chomped in half by the shark. This is a clear allusion to Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues under the Sea (1870), where his Nautilus (namesake of the real submarine) is less successfully attacked by a giant cuttlefish (Alten, Meg 198; Verne 309-17). Meanwhile, in Alten's 1999 sequel The Trench, an industrialist's attempts to study the megalodon are revealed as an excuse to mine helium-3 from the seafloor to build fusion reactors, a plot financed by none other than a pre-9/11 Osama bin Laden in order to allow the Saudis to take over the global economy, in the process linking the megalodon with a monster of an entirely different type (Alten, Trench 261-62). In most adaptations of Verne's novel, the cuttlefish that attacks the Nautilus is replaced by a giant squid, traditionally seen as the basis for the kraken of Norse myth (Thone 191). The kraken/giant squid dichotomy is present in the video game Stranded Deep. In it, the player's unnamed avatar is a businessman whose plane crashes into a tropical sea, and must survive by scavenging resources, crafting shelters, and fighting predators across various islands. Which sea in particular does the player crash into? It is hard to say, as the only indication of specific location comes from the three `boss' creatures the player must fight. One of them is Abaia, a creature from Melanesian mythology; another is Lusca, a creature from Caribbean mythology; the third is a megalodon. Lusca and Abaia, despite being creatures of mythology, are depicted as a giant squid and a giant moray eel, respectively. But the megalodon is portrayed as itself. Stranded Deep serves as a perfect distillation of the megalodon mythos: the shark is its own mythological basis, and its own cryptid equivalent. References Alten, Steven. Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror.

  abstract = {A cultural study of video game afterlife, whether as emulation or artifact, in an archival box or at the bottom of a landfill. We purchase video games to play them, not to save them. What happens to video games when they are out of date, broken, nonfunctional, or obsolete? Should a game be considered an ``ex-game'' if it exists only as emulation, as an artifact in museum displays, in an archival box, or at the bottom of a landfill? In Game After, Raiford Guins focuses on video games not as hermetically sealed within time capsules of the past but on their material remains: how and where video games persist in the present. Guins meticulously investigates the complex life cycles of video games, to show how their meanings, uses, and values shift in an afterlife of disposal, ruins and remains, museums, archives, and private collections. Guins looks closely at video games as museum objects, discussing the recontextualization of the Pong and Brown Box prototypes and engaging with curatorial and archival practices across a range of cultural institutions; aging coin-op arcade cabinets; the documentation role of game cartridge artwork and packaging; the journey of a game from flawed product to trash to memorialized relic, as seen in the history of Atari's infamous E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial; and conservation, restoration, and re-creation stories told by experts including Van Burnham, Gene Lewin, and Peter Takacs. The afterlife of video games---whether behind glass in display cases or recreated as an iPad app---offers a new way to explore the diverse topography of game history.},

Working towards unraveling layers of motifs, I will approach Journey as a cybertext and mythic text, drawing on works ranging from philosophical treatises, poetry, sacred narratives and shamanism for comparative analysis. My initial task is to establish the video game as a participatory rendering of the Hero's Journey, while then breaking the cycle into individual components of motifs, themes and mythemes to parse the discourse of Journey's exposition. I then argue for Journey's ongoing engagement with reimagining the gaming experience through a commitment to synergistic immersion in a myth-minded environment.},

  abstract = {This dissertation treats the reception, performance, and mediation of myth in video games. Myths are included in video games as variants in relation to other myth-variants. This study does not focus on contemporary myths per se, but rather modernized forms of myths modified for a contemporary audience of players, users, and consumers who participate in video game culture. Different video games involve and invoke different mythologies. Thus, different theories about myths are drawn on to extrapolate meaningful applications in the world of each video game. Some case studies involve the creative uses of depth psychology, the hero pattern, otherworldly journeys, mythic-epic story structures, and/or explorations in specific mythological themes and motifs. Pluralistic, folkloristic, and close cross-cultural comparison is exercised on a case-by-case basis--- pace universal and wide-range comparativism---to effectively account for comparison and context. Case studies include single-player video games involving different sub-genres, online multiplayer video games, and a massively multiplayer online game that includes field work reports and analysis. The descriptive process and meta-theory that I propose stem from the playfulness that myths presented in video games afford: first, interpretatio ludi is the general process of transposing mythological traditions and systems into dynamic and playable models, or the invention anew of mythological systems tailored to a particular video game world and genre. Players virtually participate in myths as voyeurs, voyagers and (sometimes) builders. This raises important questions regarding artificial and emergent mythmaking occurring on the side of either player response, from the developers, or from instances of co-creation between both. I also present the "agonistic theory of myth" to account for the inherent and pervasive tendency of contestation between myth-variants, myths of divine conflict, and theories about myth(s). A critical review of scholarship on myths and games is also included. This dissertation proposes that mythological studies and game studies can pursue significant collaborative research trajectories. The overall aim of this study is to develop a critical media-conscious approach to myths, and a myth-conscious approach to media.},

Drawing on an HMC framework, we outline a research agenda built around three key aspects of communicative AI technologies: (1) the functional dimensions through which people make sense of these devices and applications as communicators, (2) the relational dynamics through which people associate with these technologies and, in turn, relate to themselves and others, and (3) the metaphysical implications called up by blurring ontological boundaries surrounding what constitutes human, machine, and communication.},

  abstract = {The ``Souls-like'' role-playing video game genre was inadvertently created due to the influence of the ``Souls franchise''. However, each game has different twists which can be new gameplay mechanics, graphical style, etc. while maintaining the core elements of the ``Souls franchise''. The goal of this study is to understand which gameplay mechanics are more liked by comparing reviews of these games to each other. Thus, different game design elements and game mechanics are investigated in 21 ``Souls-like'' video games to see how the users reacted to them and whether they positively reviewed them. All (993,932) reviews were scraped from the Steam webpage regarding these games in the middle of April 2021 using the steam\_reviews Python package. These reviews contain the playtime at review, whether a positive or negative rating is given, and a textual component among others. Overall, 11 various game design elements and game mechanics were set up for the investigation: the setting, graphical dimensions as well as style, level design, and whether there are difficulty settings, multiplayer features, upgradeable weapons/armor, equipment durability, in-game map, extra penalties upon death, and a classic level-up system. Based on data distributions, either the t-test or the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test was used for the analysis. The syuzhet package, which uses Natural Language Processing methods, was used in the statistical program package R along with the NRC Emotion Lexicon to evaluate the textual parts. According to the results, a slight-to-moderate correlation exists between positive reviews and the users' playtimes: more playtimes mean a larger chance of having positive reviews. Significant differences also exist in the percentages of positive reviews among these games: Hollow Knight is the most liked game. Out of the investigated 11 factors, significant differences exist among all of them: drawn graphics (96.48\%) and 2D style (95.61\%) are the two most liked factors, while pixel graphics (87.11\%) and a futuristic setting (86.74\%) are the two least liked ones. Almost every factor can significantly affect all eight basic emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust). The exceptions are graphical dimensions, weapon/armor upgradability, in-game map, and extra penalties upon character death~as no significant differences exist in case of trust (p = 0.85), anger (p = 0.24), sadness (p = 0.21) and disgust (p = 0.095), respectively when the average sentiments per review were examined. Future ``Souls-like'' game design and development can be influenced by the results as game developers can more easily choose from the factors they want to implement or whether they want them at all in their games. \copyright{} 2022, The Author(s).},

These elements offer a different kind of inner motivation to learning, which usually is highly welcomed among students.

Alas, the planning system in the game is streamlined and does not include a realistic view of a city planning process with its multiple participants and developers. However, the city as a functioning system is well modeled and has some real potential for educational purposes. As a stand-alone game Cities Skylines does not fully meet the requirements for an educational game in the field of real estate or city planning. Nonetheless, the game is an exceptionally well developed platform and supports plethora of modifications. With a select few, well-thought modifications, the game would support educational uses, especially city planning problem solving using scenarios.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Game Culture and GenderAs texts with the potential to help mediate specific forms of identity, video games are rich and complex sites for analysis. A tendency, however, still exists in scholarship to treat video games as just another kind of text, and work that explores the expression of masculine identity persists in drawing from cinematic analysis without proper consideration of game design and how these games are played (Triana). For example, insights from studies into horror cinema may illuminate the relationship between players and game systems in survival horror video games (Habel \& Kooyman), but further study is needed to explore how people interact with the game.This article aims to build towards a scholarly definition of the term ``Power Fantasy'', a concept that seems well established in wider discourse but is not yet well theorised in the scholarly literature. It does so through a case of the most recent reboot of Doom (2016), a game that in its original incarnation established an enduring tradition for high-action Power Fantasy. In the first-person shooter game Doom, the player fills the role of the ``Doom Guy'', a faceless hero who shuttles between Earth and Hell with the sole aim of eviscerating demonic hordes as graphically as possible.How, then, do we begin to theorise the kind of automediation that an iconic game text like Doom facilitates? Substantial work has been done to explore player identification in online games (see Taylor; Yee). Shaw (``Rethinking'') suggests that single-player games are unexplored territory compared to the more social spaces of Massively Multiplayer Online games and other multiplayer experiences, but it is important to distinguish between direct identification with the avatar per se and the ways in which the game text mediates broader gender constructions.Abstract theorisation is not enough, though. To effectively understand this kind of automediation we also need a methodology to gain insights into its processes. The final part of this article, therefore, proposes the analysis of ``Let's Play'' videos as a kind of gender identity performance which gives insight into the automediation of dominant masculine gender identities through Power Fantasy video games like Doom. This reflexive performance works to denaturalise gender construction rather than reinforce stable hegemonic identities.Power Fantasy and Gender IdentityPower Fantasy has become an established trope in online critiques and discussions of popular culture. It can be simply defined as ``character imagines himself taking revenge on his bullies'' (TVTropes). This trope takes on special resonance in video games, where the players themselves live out the violent revenge fantasy in the world of the game.The ``power fantasy'' of games implies escapism and meaninglessness, evoking outsize explosions and equally outsized displays of dominance. A ``power gamer'' is one who plays with a single-minded determination to win, at the expense of nuance, social relationships between players, or even their own pleasure in play. (Baker)Many examples apply this concept of Power Fantasy in video games: from God of War to Metroid: Prime and Grand Theft Auto, this prevalent trope of game design uses a kind of ``agency mechanics'' (Habel \& Kooyman) to convince the player that they are becoming increasingly skilful in the game, when in reality the game is simply decreasing in difficulty (PBS Digital Studios). The operation of the Power Fantasy trope is also gendered; in a related trope known as ``I Just Want To Be a Badass'', ``males are somewhat more prone to harbour [the] wish'' to feel powerful (TVTropes). ~More broadly, even though the game world is obviously not real, playing it requires ``an investment in and commitment to a type of masculine performance that is based on the Real (particularly if one is interested in `winning', pummelling your opponent, kicking ass, etc.)'' (Burrill 2).Indeed, there is a perceived correlation (if not causation) between the widespread presence of Power Fantasy video games and how ``game culture as it stands is shot through with sexism, racism, homophobia, and other biases'' (Baker). Golding and van Deventer undertake an extended exploration of this disconcerting side of game culture, concluding that games have ``become a venue for some of the more unsophisticated forms of patriarchy'' (213) evidenced in the highly-publicised GamerGate movement. This saw an alignment between the label of ``gamer'' and extreme misogyny, abuse and harassment of women and other minorities in the industry.We have, then, a tentative connection between dominant gameplay forms based on high skill that may be loosely characterised as ``Power Fantasy'' and some of the most virulent toxic gender expressions seen in recent times. More research is needed to gain a clearer understanding of precisely what Power Fantasy is. Baker's primary argument is that ``power'' in games can also be characterised as ``power to'' or ``power with'', as well as the more traditional ``power over''. Kurt Squire uses the phrase ``Power Fantasy'' as a castaway framing for a player who seeks an alternative reward to the usual game progression in Sid Meier's Civilisation. More broadly, much scholarly work concerning gameplay design and gender identity has been focussed on the hot-button question of videogame violence and its connection to real-world violence, a question that this article avoids since it is well covered elsewhere. Here, a better understanding of the mediation of gender identity through Power Fantasy in Doom can help to illuminate how games function as automedia.Auto-Mediating Gender through Performance in Doom (2016) As a franchise, Doom commands near-incomparable respect as a seminal text of the first-person shooter genre. First released in 1993, it set the benchmark for 3D rendered graphics, energetic sound design, and high-paced action gameplay that was visceral and deeply immersive. It is impossible to mention more recent reboots without recourse to its first seminal instalment and related game texts: Kim Justice suggests a personal identification with it in a 29-minute video analysis entitled ``A Personal History of Demon Slaughter''. Doom is a cherished game for many players, possibly because it evokes memories of ``boyhood'' gaming and all its attendant gender identity formation (Burrill).This identification also arises in livestreams and playthroughs of the game. YouTuber and game reviewer Markiplier describes nostalgically and at lengths his formative experiences playing it (and recounts a telling connection with his father who, he explains, introduced him to gaming), saying ``Doom is very important to me [\dots ] this was the first game that I sat down and played over and over and over again.'' In contrast, Wanderbots confesses that he has never really played Doom, but acknowledges its prominent position in the gaming community by designating himself outside the identifying category of ``Doom fan''. He states that he has started playing due to ``gushing'' recommendations from other gamers. The nostalgic personal connection is important, even in absentia.For the most part, the critical and community response to the 2016 version of Doom was approving: Gilroy admits that it ``hit all the right power chords'', raising the signature trope in reference to both gameplay and music (a power chord is a particular technique of playing heavy metal guitar often used in heavy metal music). Doom's Metacritic score is currently a respectable 85, and, the reception is remarkably consistent between critics and players, especially for such a potentially divisive game (Metacritic). Commentators tend to cite its focus on its high action, mobility, immersion, sound design, and general faithfulness to the spirit of the original Doom as reasons for assessments such as ``favourite game ever'' (Habel). Game critic Yahtzee's uncharacteristically approving video review in the iconic Zero Punctuation series is very telling in its assessment of the game's light narrative framing:Doom seems to have a firm understanding of its audience because, while there is a plot going on, the player-character couldn't give a half an ounce of deep fried shit; if you want to know the plot then pause the game and read all the fluff text in the character and location database, sipping daintily from your pink teacup full of pussy juice, while the game waits patiently for you to strap your bollocks back on and get back in the fray. (Yahtzee)This is a strident expression of the gendered expectations and response to Doom's narratological refusal, which is here cast as approvingly masculine and opposed to a ``feminine'' desire for plot or narrative. It also feeds into a discourse which sees the game as one which demands skill, commitment, and an achievement orientation cast within an exclusivist ideology of ``toxic meritocracy'' (Paul).In addition to examining reception, approaches to understanding how Doom functions as a ``Power Fantasy'' or ``badass'' trope could take a variety of forms. It is tempting to undertake a detailed analysis of its design and gameplay, especially since these feed directly into considerations of player interaction. This could direct a critical focus towards gameplay design elements such as traversal and mobility, difficulty settings, ``glory kills'', and cinematic techniques in the same vein as Habel and Kooyman's analysis of survival horror video games in relation to horror cinema. However, Golding and van Deventer warn against a simplistic analysis of decontextualized gameplay (29-30), and there is a much more intriguing possibility hinted at by Harper's notion of ``Play Practice''.It is useful to analyse a theoretical engagement with a video game as a thought-experiment. But with the rise of gaming as spectacle, and particularly gaming as performance through ``Let's Play'' livestreams (or video on demand) on platforms such as TwitchTV and YouTube, it becomes possible to analyse embodied performances of the gameplay of such video games. This kind of analysis allows the opportunity for a more nuanced understanding of how such games mediate gender identities. For Judith Butler, gender is not only performed, it is also performative:Because there is neither an ``essence'' that gender expresses or externalizes nor an objective ideal to which gender aspires, and because gender is not a fact, the various acts of gender create the idea of gender, and without those acts, there would be no gender at all. (214)Let's Play videos---that show a player playing a game in real time with their commentary overlaying the on screen action---allow us to see the performative aspects of gameplay. Let's Plays are a highly popular and developing form: they are not simple artefacts by any means, and can be understood as expressive works in their own right (Lee). They are complex and multifaceted, and while they do not necessarily provide direct insights into the player's perception of their own identification, with sufficient analysis and unpacking they help us to explore both the construction and denaturalisation of gender identity. In this case, we follow Josef Nguyen's analysis of Let's Plays as essential for expression of player identity through performance, but instead focus on how some identity construction may narrow rather than expand the diversity range. T.L. Taylor also has a monograph forthcoming in 2018 titled Watch Me Play: Twitch and the Rise of Game Live Streaming, suggesting the time is ripe for such analysis.These performances are clear in ways we have already discussed: for example, both SplatterCat and Markiplier devote significant time to describing their formative experiences playing Doom as a background to their gameplay performance, while Wanderbots is more distanced. There is no doubt that these videos are popular: Markiplier, for example, has attracted nearly 5 million views of his Doom playthrough. If we see gameplay as automediation, though, these videos become useful artefacts for analysis of gendered performance through gameplay.When SplatterCat discovers the suit of armor for the game's protagonist, Doom Guy, he half-jokingly remarks ``let us be all of the Doom Guy that we can possibly be'' (3:20). This is an aspirational mantra, a desire for enacting the game's Power Fantasy. Markiplier speaks at length about his nostalgia for the game, specifically about how his father introduced him to Doom when he was a child, and he expresses hopes that he will again experience ``Doom's original super-fast pace and just pure unadulterated action; Doom Guy is a badass'' (4:59). As the action picks up early into the game, Markiplier expresses the exhilaration and adrenaline that accompany performances of this fastpaced, highly mobile kind of gameplay, implying that he is becoming immersed in the character and, by performing Doom Guy, inhabiting the ``badass'' role and thus enacting a performance of Power Fantasy:Doom guy---and I hope I'm playing Doom guy himself---is just the embodiment of kickass. He destroys everything and he doesn't give a fuck about what he breaks in the process. (8:45)This performance of gender through the skilled control of Doom Guy is, initially, unambiguously mediated as Power Fantasy: in control, highly skilled, suffused with Paul's `toxic meritocracy. ~A similar sentiment is expressed in Wanderbots' playthrough when the player-character dispenses with narrative/conversation by smashing a computer terminal: ``Oh I like this guy already! Alright. Doom Guy does not give a shit. It's like Wolf Blascowicz [sic], but like, plus plus'' (Wanderbots). This is a reference to another iconic first-person shooter franchise, Wolfenstein, which also originated in the 1980s and has experienced a recent successful reboot, and which operates in a similar Power Fantasy mode. This close alignment between these two streamers' performances suggests significant coherence in both genre and gameplay design and the ways in which players engage with the game as a gendered performative space.Nonetheless, there is no simple one-to-one relationship here---there is not enough evidence to argue that this kind of gameplay experience leads directly to the kind of untrammelled misogyny we see in game culture more broadly. While Gabbiadini et al. found evidence in an experimental study that a masculinist ideology combined with violent video game mechanics could lead to a lack of empathy for women and girls who are victims of violence, Ferguson and Donnellan dispute this finding based on poor methodology, arguing that there is no evidence for a causal relationship between gender, game type and lack of empathy for women and girls. This inconclusiveness in the research is mirrored by an ambiguity in the gendered performance of males playing through Doom, where the Power Fantasy is profoundly undercut in multiple ways.Wanderbots' Doom playthrough is literally titled `I have no idea what I'm Dooming' and he struggles with particular mechanics and relatively simple progression tools early in the game: this reads against masculinist stereotypes of superior and naturalised gameplay skill. Markiplier's performance of the ``badass'' Doom Guy is undercut at various stages: in encountering the iconic challenge of the game, he mentions that ``I am halfway decent\dots{} not that good at video games'' (9:58), and on the verge of the protagonist's death he admits ``If I die this early into my first video I'm going to be very disappointed, so I'm going to have to kick it up a notch'' (15:30). This suggests that rather than being an unproblematic and simple expression of male power in a fantasy video game world, the gameplay performances of Power Fantasy games are ambiguous and contested, and not always successfully performed via the avatar. They therefore demonstrate a ``kind of gender performance [which] will enact and reveal the performativity of gender itself in a way that destabilizes the naturalized categories of identity and desire'' (Butler 211). This cuts across the empowered performance of videogame mastery and physical dominance over the game world, and suggests that the automediation of gender identity through playing video games is a complex phenomenon urgently in need of further theorisation.ConclusionUltimately, this kind of analysis of the mediation of hegemonic gender identities is urgent for a cultural product as ubiquitous as video games. The hyper-empowered ``badass'' digital avatars of Power Fantasy video games can be expected to have some shaping effect on the identities of those who play them, evidenced by the gendered gameplay performance of Doom briefly explored here. This is by no means a simple or unproblematic process, though. Much further research is needed to test the methodological insights possible by using video performances of gameplay as explorations of the auto-mediation of gender identities through video games.ReferencesBaker, Meguey. ``Problematizing Power Fantasy.''

How were Old Norse, Finno-Ugric and Frisian myths employed as rhetorical devices in national narratives? And how did (and do) these new interpretations convey a sense of 'northernness'? This volume approaches these issues from an interdisciplinary and international perspective, and brings together case studies from Scandinavia, the Baltic region, Friesland, Britain, the United States and even Japan.

Using theories of affect in social media and consumer culture as a framework, I situate the New Balance case within the current culture wars as enacted in politicized social media threads, as well as prior instances in which alt-right groups have attempted to co-opt sportswear brands' cultural associations in the service of extremist politics. Performing manual inductive content analysis on a sample of tweets from before the publication of the editorial (n=100) and after (n=77), I illuminate a polarized political division between users in terms of their backlash or endorsement of New Balance's stance, which correlates with stated anti-Trump or pro-Trump positions, and articulate how users position themselves in terms of a consumer/customer relation to New Balance as brand, while sneakers become a material outlet for consumers to enact their discontent in a mediatized forum.},

  abstract = {Dear Cities fans, We see and understand the disappointment many of you have expressed after the release of Cities: Skylines II and the recent release of Beach Properties. We asked for your patience and support, and you've shown those. In return, we let you down. We thought we could make up for the shortcomings of the game in a timeframe that was unrealistic, and rushed out a DLC that should not have been published in its current form. For all this, we are truly sorry. When we've made statements like this one before, it's included a pledge to keep making improvements, and while we are working on these updates, they haven't happened at a speed or magnitude that is acceptable, and it pains us that we've now lost the trust of many of you. We want to do better. The very first thing we're doing is to compensate those who purchased Beach Properties. We will change the pack to be a free addition to the game, refund it to the extent possible, and provide additional content within the Ultimate Edition. Unfortunately, it will not be possible to offer refunds for Ultimate Edition buyers. This is due to the distribution of the Ultimate Edition across digital and physical storefronts, which create significant complexities for executing a partial refund. We realize that this is far from ideal, especially given the dedication those who have stayed with us since launch have shown. We are committed to repaying that loyalty, and therefore, we will compensate Ultimate Edition holders by adding 3 Creator Packs and 3 Radio Stations which, together, sum up to a value of USD 39.99. This solution hopefully ensures that you, regardless of purchase method, feel you receive fair compensation. Looking ahead, we also want to make immediate and meaningful changes in the way we approach the game's development and our communication with you. Firstly, this means a complete focus on improving the base game and modding tools, and secondly, we want to better involve you, the community, as we choose our priorities going forward. We will focus on additional free patches and game updates in the coming months before Colossal Order spends time on new paid content, resulting in a move of the Bridges and Ports Expansion to 2025. In addition, the aforementioned Creator Packs are being produced independently, and will not take any focus away from the work on improving the game. To make sure we focus on the right things, we're putting together an advisory meeting, where a small group of player representatives, together with Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive, will discuss the development plan for this year. The people in this group are chosen for the size of their following within the community to represent as many people as possible. The teams from Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive will provide them with full transparency and answer any questions and critiques voiced. Our hope is that together with you, our community, we can make sure that we do not repeat the same mistakes we have made in the past and bring this game into a bright future. We also want to address the pending Console release. As you know, our plan was to release in Spring of this year. We have been hesitant to communicate an actual release window because of the uncertainty we are facing, and to not make further promises we might not be able to keep. We have been struggling to get Cities: Skylines II to the necessary level of optimization for a console release, but are now hopeful that an upcoming build delivery in April will demonstrate sufficient progress for us to progress with a release candidate, and then a release build targeted for October. Before we have seen and evaluated the progress made in these builds however, we will not be able to confirm the release date, and even then, some uncertainty always remains. Our ambition is to deliver the experience that you all deserved at launch, but it will take time. It's important to note that the team working on the console release operates separately from our PC development team, so it will be progressing without splitting our focus or time. In closing, we want to reaffirm our dedication to making Cities: Skylines II the best city builder it can be. We appreciate your support and feedback, and hope we can regain your trust going forward. It's our responsibility to earn it, and we hope these actions are a first step in the right direction. We are deeply grateful for your continued passion for our game. Please stay tuned for further updates on the game and the refund process, and thank you for being a part of our community. Sincerely, Mariina Hallikainen CEO, Colossal Order Mattias Lilja Deputy CEO, Paradox Interactive},

Building on a survey of media institutions in eighteen West European and North American democracies, Hallin and Mancini identify the principal dimensions of variation in media systems and the political variables that have shaped their evolution. They go on to identify three major models of media system development, the Polarized Pluralist, Democratic Corporatist, and Liberal models; to explain why the media have played a different role in politics in each of these systems; and to explore the force of change that are currently transforming them. It provides a key theoretical statement about the relation between media and political systems, a key statement about the methodology of comparative analysis in political communication, and a clear overview of the variety of media institutions that have developed in the West, understood within their political and historical context."--Jacket},

Live streams serve as meeting grounds for player communities. The Twitch streaming medium combines broadcast video with open IRC chat channels. In conjunction with gameplay, viewer participation and community building gain emphasis. Twitch streams range in size and nature, from intimate communities with fifty viewers, to massive broadcasts with tens of thousands. In this paper, we present an ethnographic investigation of the live streaming of video games on Twitch. We find that Twitch streams act as virtual third places, in which informal communities emerge, socialize, and participate. Over time, stream communities form around shared identities drawn from streams? contents and participants? shared experiences. We describe processes through which stream communities form, the motivations of members, and emergent issues in the medium. Finally, we draw from our findings to derive implications for design of live mixed-media environments to support participatory online communities.},

  abstract = {This article paves way for a materialist analysis of the games industry as 21st century imperialism that is economically and culturally structured to cultivate anti-democratic norms that lead to fascist movements against those who question or seek to change the status quo. While much research has studied the politics of reactionary movements in gaming cultures, few have paid attention to the relation between the games industry as part of an imperialist economic system, the chauvinistic ideals symptomized in their cultural products, and the reactionist consumer audiences they attract and cultivate. As I argue, the economic structure of the industry as 21st century imperialism leads to perpetual anti-democratic crises that are maintained by reactionary forces that cultivate, attract, and form fascist grassroots organization. To conceptualize this dynamic, I invoke the labor aristocracy theory as suggested by Friedrich Engels and V.I. Lenin. This theory helps highlight the material basis from which consumers of digital games are bribed to become ideologically aligned with the chauvinism that the imperialist nature of the games industry is justified by. I also invoke W.E.B. Du Bois' concept of a public and psychological wage to highlight the chauvinistic tendencies that the games industry cultivates via their products and marketing, in which the lack of democratic and equitable representation provides the reactionary consumers a sense of superiority. Together, these approaches account for the economic and cultural bases of both the games industry and its reactionary consumers. By anchoring my analysis in critical theories on imperialism and race, the article identifies the root causes of organized harassment and chauvinism in game cultures, as well as how the industry as 21st century imperialism benefits from and is protected by these forces of reaction.},

  abstract = {This article advances the research on unionization and collective organizing in the games industry by highlighting potential future challenges of international solidarity as identified by the Marxist concept of labor aristocracy. While much of organizing and unionization in the games industry are in their nascent stages by focusing primarily on the national question and the nature of work in the games industry, the nature of global supply chains, and free flow of capital emphasizes the importance of global perspectives on how game workers can organize. Primarily, this article is concerned with the material effects of 21st century imperialism on collective organization, where the Marxist concept of labor aristocracy identifies the privileged strata of game workers in imperialist countries who benefit from exploitative international relations between core and periphery economies through higher wages, positions of power, and affordable access to commodities. As a result, these groups of game workers should, according to the implications of labor aristocracy, hold a material investment into maintaining the exploitation of game workers in the periphery. This means that the current social movements to organize and unionize in the games industry potentially encounters the challenge of international solidarity with workers whose exploitation those in the imperialist countries benefit from. This article identifies such challenges through interviews and an online survey with game workers, organizers, union representatives, and leaders of international organizations. The findings reveal the international character of game work and the challenges of national legislation; the importance and challenge of building solidarity between game workers in the core and periphery; and finally, the potential strategies for unions and organizers to cultivate international solidarity. Thus, the article clears a forward path for both production research in game studies and labor organizing in the Western games industry through a global perspective on international material relations and historical materialism.},

This case study highlights that the hegemonic articulations of colonial histories are not exclusive to Western entertainment products where instead modes of production matter in the `manufacturing of mnemonic hegemony'. I also propose that the propaganda model, while instructive, can be improved further by acknowledging a technological filter and the role of the subaltern. Thus, the article furthers the understanding of the relation between production and form in contemporary technological phenomena like video games and how this relation motivates hegemonic articulations of the past in contemporary mass culture.},

In putting together this special issue, our hope is to identify new developments in the game industry and academia that are emblematic of 21st-century capitalism. Just as Games of Empire popularised critical political-economic perspectives ten~years ago, we encourage others, as the authors in this issue did, to continue and maintain investigations into questions of ownership, privatized property, coercive class relations, military operations and radical struggle. Such analyses are necessary not only to trace but also to open up new directions in game culture and academia for decades to come.},

By couching our analysis in Marxist, feminist, anti-fascist, and anti-imperialist understandings of how our social relations arise from the historical-material basis of society, we identify several different conditions of modern digital games that everyone working in and around games should confront and take seriously, especially regarding contemporary and future impacts and restrictions on the type of research and education we are able to conduct. These crises emerge from social and economic structures including imperialism, racism, militarism, fascism, and patriarchy. To better confront them, we broadly define the causes from which the morbid symptoms we witness arise in primarily Western societies and how they manifest in the games industry, its consumers, and its academic institutions.~Based off these aspects, we extrapolate their trajectory in how they will change and adapt to the future of games and of their study, as the ecological and social crises intensify and reverberate. This allows us to propose potential strategies for radically confronting and potentially overcoming the looming crises related to war, patriarchy, white supremacy, famine, destitution, fascism, and climate apocalypse.},

In legend the human actors respond with fear and awe, whereas in folktale they treat such beings as if they were ordinary and unremarkable. Since folktale humans treat all characters as belonging to a single realm, folklorists have described the world of the folktale as one-dimensional, in contrast to the two-dimensionality of the legend. The present investigation examines dimensionality in the third major genre of folk narrative: myth. Using the Greek and Hebrew myths of primordial paradise as sample narratives, the present essay finds---surprisingly---that the humans in these stories respond to the otherworldly one-dimensionally, as folktale characters do, and suggests an explanation for their behavior that is peculiar to the world of myth.},

Thus, publication workload per scientist has increased dramatically. We define this problem as ``the strain on scientific publishing.'' To analyze this strain, we present five data-driven metrics showing publisher growth, processing times, and citation behaviors. We draw these data from web scrapes, and from publishers through their websites or upon request. Specific groups have disproportionately grown in their articles published per year, contributing to this strain. Some publishers enabled this growth by hosting ``special issues'' with reduced turnaround times. Given pressures on researchers to ``publish or perish'' to compete for funding, this strain was likely amplified by these offers to publish more articles. We also observed widespread year-over-year inflation of journal impact factors coinciding with this strain, which risks confusing quality signals. Such exponential growth cannot be sustained. The metrics we define here should enable this evolving conversation to reach actionable solutions to address the strain on scientific publishing.},

Conspiracy theories have become popular cultural products, endorsed and shared by significant segments of western societies. Yet our understanding of who these people are and why they are attracted by these alternative explanations of reality is hampered by their implicit and explicit pathologization. Drawing on a wide variety of empirical sources, this book shows in rich detail what conspiracy theories are about, which people are involved, how they see themselves, and what they practically do with these ideas in their everyday lives. The author inductively develops from these concrete descriptions more general theorizations of how to understand this burgeoning subculture. He concludes by situating conspiracy culture in an age of epistemic instability where societal conflicts over knowledge abound, and the Truth is no longer assured, but "out there" for us to grapple with. This book will be an important source for students and scholars from a range of disciplines interested in the depth and complexity of conspiracy culture, including Anthropology, Cultural Studies, Communication Studies, Ethnology, Folklore Studies, History, Media Studies, Political Science, Psychology and Sociology. More broadly, this study speaks to contemporary (public) debates about truth and knowledge in a supposedly post-truth era, including widespread popular distrusts towards elites, mainstream institutions and their knowledge"--},

We therefore performed a qualitative content analysis of 522 comments under a Dutch newspaper article on conspiracy theories to study how ordinary people discuss post-truth matters. We found four main points of controversy: ``habitus of distrust''; ``who to involve in public debates''; ``which ways of knowing to allow''; and ``what is at stake?'' The diverging opinions outline the limits of pluralism in a post-truth era, revealing tensions between technocratic and democratic ideals in society. We show that popular opinions on conspiracy theories embody more complexity and nuance than elite conceptions of post-truth allow for: they lay bare the multiple sociological dimensions of poly-truth.},

In this paper, we describe a formal literature review of game streaming research. Papers were coded for their research focus, primary method, and type of data collected. Across the prior work we found three common themes: (1) work that is readily supported by existing technical infrastructure, (2) work that does not require explicit technical support, (3) and work that would benefit from further technical development. By identifying these needs in the literature, we take the first step toward developing a research toolkit for game streaming platforms that can unify the breadth of methods being applied in the space.},

Hasan Piker is one of the most popular political influencers on Twitch, which he uses as a base to organize and direct his audience into coordinated actions across multiple platforms. Piker reigns on Twitch, but has significantly less Twitter followers than all of his targets, meaning the ratio strategy prompts targeted actions that simultaneously increase his visibility. This article uses three case studies to highlight ratioing as a strategy for eliciting political participation, such as when Piker ratioed rivaling political influencers, a US Senator, and a famous rapper.},

The current approach to quest design is dominated by a task-orientated paradigm in which a quest is viewed as a series of tasks to be completed as part of the narrative structure of the game. This paper presents an alternative paradigm that shifts away from the predominant task-based approach to quest design. Based on a study of existing quest models, a dual quest framework of singular and synergy quests is proposed. Within the frameworks, tasks become an intermediary step within the quest which is now focused on the transfiguration of the player character. This approach offers a practical design structure for both procedural and manual quest design. \copyright{} The Author(s) 2023.},

Expanding on research in the area of identity theory, and applying aspects of personality construction, the study explores the interaction between players' personality dimensions, as an expression of their self-concept, and their perception of ideal personality traits, in the creation and use of avatars within a largely open-world videogame. The study sampled 54 subjects (27 females; 27 males) who played the game Skyrim for a prolonged period, then compared five-factor personality inventory scores of actual self, ideal self, and projected self through bivariate correlation analysis. The five factors tested were: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience. Results indicate that while strong correlation exists between subjects' actual self scores and ideal self scores in four out of five tested dimensions, indicating low cognitive dissonance and discrepancy regarding personality, moderate to strong levels of correlation only exist between ideal self and projected self in the dimension of openness to experience. Similar results were found between actual self scores and projected self scores. This indicates that players may be more likely to experiment with alternate self constructs in most aspects of personality, than to build and play avatars according to either actual self or ideal self constructs. A discussion of the greater implication of the results, mitigating factors, and future research opportunities is included.},

  abstract = {How do violent videogames, as entertainment products, communicate violence in the context of warfare and in other settings? Also, why do users enjoy virtual violence? The present article introduces the Moral Disengagement in Violent Videogames model to tackle these important questions. The model resulted from empirical insights gained in (Media) Psychology and Communication Science. These disciplinary research findings are reviewed in the present article to substantiate the four core propositions of the model. First, the model refutes the view that users enjoy virtual violence primarily because they are constantly aware that "this game is not real." Instead, the model follows experimental findings suggesting that videogame users are inclined to automatically feel present in virtual environments and (despite better knowledge) may intuitively feel like actually enacting violence against social beings. Second, if users feel as if virtual characters have a mind of their own, they may also assign a moral status to them. Third, this finding implies that enacted unjustified transgressions against virtual characters may trigger discomfort in users. Fourth, most violent videogames are designed for entertainment purposes. Therefore, the games might frequently embed cues that effectively frame violence enacted against seemingly social beings as "okay." Therefore, users may become morally disengaged and enjoy the violence, rather than experiencing feelings of subjective discomfort, such as guilt. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the boundaries of the proposed model and alternative explanations.},

I argue that this progressive ethos, coupled with the performative nature of modern speedrunning, lends a distinctly artistic character to the practice. Speedrunning is a form of (post)human expression that is manifested not only through the programming of a video game, but also through players' approach to gameplay. By choosing to speedrun, players actively impose a discrete temporal limit on the inhuman algorithms of video games, and so attempt to conquer and thereby curtail their technological novelty. However, within the field of game studies, the literature published on speedrunning to date is almost unilaterally anthropocentric, and focuses on the transgressive nature of the practice, ignoring the intricacies of its technological fundament. Rather, (post)humans and technologies interact in a transformational manner through intra-active assemblages, broadening the condition of embodiment. To theorize a posthumanistic theory of the practice, this article takes as its focus the speedrunning community of the video game Super Mario Odyssey and suggests that speedrunning may ultimately be considered a mode of (post)human performance art.},

  abstract = {This thesis considers the phenomenological experience of e-reading (reading on an electronic screen) as a way-in to discussing wider issues of technology and our encounter with objects in our environments. By considering the resistance shown toward reading on iPads and Kindles in popular and academic discourse as a source of valuable ``folk phenomenological'' report, this thesis hopes to shed light on both the particular engagement of portable e-reading and the general experience of embodied encounters with artefacts. The first chapter will consider the shortcomings of contemporary definitions of technology and aims to provide its own definition commensurate to the task of describing the intimate and very human encounter with equipment, an encounter which will be described as ``technological.'' In the second chapter an ontology (begun in the background of the first) will be developed which primarily considers our encounter with things that are as embodied as ourselves. This ontology sees evolution as an epistemological concern, with every evolutionary act occurring as a response to environmental pressures and producing a knowledge of that environment. This knowledge, it will be argued, in light of conclusions drawn from an engagement with Object Oriented Ontology, can be tested only via repeatable successful action with that which might be known. Such evolutionary concerns, it will be further argued, are equally applicable to our artefacts. The third chapter will focus on metaphor and critical theory to consider how e-reading in particular might function as a material metaphor, enabling productive thought. It will conclude with readings of three texts which put the language of all three chapters to work. This thesis draws on several fields, including Critical Theory, Cognitive Neuroscience, Evolutionary Epistemology, and Philosophy, the bringing together of which is intended to be of use to the still emerging Digital Humanities and the work's home discipline of English Studies as it gets used to the substantial alterations in the substrate of its object of study.},

  abstract = {In ``Modes of Cognition: Implications for Large Language Models'', N. Katherine Hayles proposes a broadened framework for understanding cognition, extending it beyond conscious human thought to include implicit, nonconscious, and even non-neural processes. Using the SIRAL criteria---sensing, interpreting, responding, anticipating, and learning---she explores cognition across organisms from bacteria to plants, arguing that many life forms meet the cognitive threshold despite lacking brains. Hayles then applies these insights to large language models (LLMs), contending that their behavior satisfies the modified SIRAL criteria. Although LLMs lack physical embodiment, they navigate and interpret vast conceptual environments, produce flexible and anticipatory responses, and learn from data. Their cognitive capacities, she argues, stem not from consciousness but from their place within a broader evolutionary lineage of technics. By reframing cognition and decentering anthropocentric models, Hayles opens pathways to new ethical frameworks for engaging with artificial and biological intelligences alike.},

On its surface, the fights have two reasons: 1) to weaken and capture wild pok\'emon, and 2) to defeat other pok\'emon trainers. The pok\'emon themselves are various, having different appearances, names, powers, potentials, weaknesses, and personalities. The actual form of the game, again, on its surface, takes several forms: 1) the card game, 2) the Gameboy versions, 3) the Nintendo 64 version, 4) the cartoons and movies, and 5) the various toys, merchandise, and artifacts. How these various aspects figure in this discussion of play is the subject of this paper, and thus further elaboration is available in following sections.},

First, it extends the range of economic ideas that have been applied to massively-multiplayer online games (MMOGs), drawing on scale economies, exchange rates, and information failure. It does this, as its second purpose, by deepening the analysis of one relatively-neglected aspect of virtual economies---gold farming (the production of MMOG virtual currencies, items, and services for financial gain) and trading---in order to understand in-game, out-game, and hybrid aspects of this activity. Third, the paper draws conclusions about two key real/virtual issues on which earlier literature has disagreed. One is the extent to which standard/real-world economic models are applicable to virtual economies. The paper argues a strong fit of standard models for analysis of gold farming and trading with little need for modification, but that MMOGs may be better understood through the lens of development economics rather than mainstream economics. The other issue discussed is the nature of the relation between the realand the virtual. On this, the paper concludes that gold farming is part of a dynamic that has eroded the real/virtual dichotomy. At the least, gold farming and trading represents the intersection and blurring of the real and the virtual. At most, it reflects their indistinguishability. Finally, the paper ends by identifying alternative systemic models for understanding gold farming specifically, and MMOGs more generally.},

The violence of World War I-- where the co-option of science by the military and state in the name of civilization made possible industrial-scale killing -- persists in haunting the collective psyche even as, on a `rational' level, we continue to invest in the contrary hope that this technology is future-orientated and will solve the problems of the world. The latest concerns around artificial intelligence and autonomous killer robots highlight the ways in which what Freud referred to as `the death drive' and `the destructive impulse' govern the logic of both our anxiety about and celebration of this technology. The second part of the article reviews the complicated relationship between science and fiction, where on the one hand science uses fiction to promote its inventions and on the other warns that the fears fuelled by the `hype' of fiction hinder its progress and thus must be exiled from `serious' discussions of science. I conclude that, on the contrary, science needs fiction to assist in restoring an ethical impulse to this technology.},

I am particularly concerned with how the notion of ontology is bound up in questions of race and gender, and with the entanglements of technology and biology that can destabilise apparently fixed boundaries between the (natural/normative) human and its (constructed/abnormal) Others. I identify three trajectories of passing as human in the histories of science fiction. The first trajectory discusses ontological mimicry: the ways in which the non-human attempts to be like the human. The second trajectory addresses how passing as human relies on a Butlerian performativity: doing human-ness by complying with the regulatory frames for appearances and practices. The final trajectory discusses what is at stake in contemporary ontological politics of recognition: a renegotiation of human supremacy through an emphasis on collectivity and collaboration rather that singularity and boundedness.},

The survey is followed by an analysis and discussion on how different types of biases are connected and depend on each other. We conclude that there is a complex relation between bias occurring in the machine learning pipeline that leads to a model, and the eventual bias of the model (which is typically related to social discrimination).

The destruction enacted by these antagonists is not entirely negative; rather, it is a part of the cycle of rebirth that is necessary for the renewal of Hyrule both within the series mythology and in the context of the player's delight in the postapocalyptic and preindustrial green spaces that characterize the games in the Zelda franchise. A close reading of the original Japanese-language script of Breath of the Wild (2017), Skyward Sword (2011), and The Wind Waker (2002) reveals that the various permutations of Ganon add cultural depth to the games, thus endowing the conflicts underlying their stories with a greater sense of literary complexity.},

  abstract = {Speedrunning is a kind of `metagame' involving video games. Though it does not yet have the kind of profile of multiplayer e-sports, speedrunning is fast approaching e-sports in popularity. Aside from audience numbers, however, from the perspective of the philosophy of sport and games, speedrunning is particularly interesting. To the casual player or viewer, speedrunning appears to be a highly irreverent, even pointless, way of playing games, particularly due to the incorporation of ``glitches''. For many outside the speedrunning community, the use of glitches appears to be cheating. For speedrunners, however, glitches are entirely within the bounds of acceptability. Because of this, however, speedrunning frequently involves sidestepping what are typically taken to be the core challenges of the game. By examining the distinction between the use of glitches and cheating in speedrunning, we can gain a greater understanding of the unique ethos of this activity; that is, we can make sense of what fundamentally constitutes speedrunning as a metagame. I argue that by understanding the code of the game not as rules but as physics, and by examining what actions are deemed impermissible by the speedrunning community -- such as hardware modification and hacking -- we can see that the ethos of speedrunning has three components: constitutive skills (including dexterity, memorisation and mental fortitude); a collective, fine-grained knowledge of the game and the desire to subvert the intentions of the programmers. Each of these components limits and structures the earlier ones: collective knowledge takes priority over constitutive skills, and subversion takes priority over both. These three components form the ethos that structures speedrunning as a metagame, expressing what speedrunners take to be its central aim.},

Offering a general theory of play as behavior promoting self-realization, Henricks articulates a conception of self that includes individual and social identity, particular and transcendent connection, and multiple fields of involvement. Henricks also evaluates play styles from history and contemporary life to analyze the relationship between play and human freedom. Imaginative and stimulating, Play and the Human Condition shows how play allows us to learn about our qualities and those of the world around us--and in so doing make sense of ourselves.},

While mediatization research is concerned with the fundamental interrelation between the transformation of media and communications and cultural and societal changes, the much younger field of HMC delves into human meaning-making in interactions with machines. However, the recent wave of ``deep mediatization,'' characterized by an increasing emphasis on general communicative automation and the rise of communicative AI, highlights a shared interest in technology's role within human interaction. This introductory article examines the trajectories of both fields, demonstrating how mediatization research ``zooms out'' from overarching questions of societal and cultural transformations, while HMC tends to ``zoom in'' to approach the concrete situatedness of the interaction between humans and machines. It is argued that we need to combine both perspectives to better understand how the automation of communication transforms the social construction of culture and society. This article offers an overview of the key themes explored in this thematic issue, highlighting the productive intersection of HMC and mediatization within each article. Additionally, it identifies potential avenues for future research emerging from this fruitful intersection.},

This can be problematic when exploring the representation of gender from the perspective of player's experiences. I argue that one way to overcome this is to use corpus linguistic methods. In this paper, the videogame series The Witcher (CD Projekt Red, 2007, CD Projekt Red, 2011, CD Projekt Red, 2015) is taken as a case study for lexico-grammatical analysis of the representation of gender via corpus methods. Keyword analysis shows that male characters are more likely to occur than female characters and have a more diverse range of professions than female characters. I argue that the main female characters of the game are typically sorceresses, and so I explore how this term is used across the corpus. The analysis demonstrates that sorceresses are represented as educated and intelligent, but subject to a glass ceiling effect: they are only ever advisors and not leaders. I argue that regardless of what options players choose, they are statistically more likely to encounter these problematic representations of gender, thus raising questions about whether it is possible to escape sexist discourses in this medium.},

The videogame series under analysis is The Witcher, which has three instalments: The Witcher 1 (2007), The Witcher 2 (2011), and The Witcher 3 (2015). The research aims to tackle four research questions. The first research question seeks to explore whether gendered lexemes are salient in this data via a corpus-driven approach. The second research question relates to how the singular nouns man and woman are used to construct gender roles, and thus uses corpus-assisted methods. The third research question signals a departure from traditional corpus methods and is concerned with player choice. Players can choose different options in these videogames, and I have examined how this might allow for different representations of gender. Finally, the fourth research question seeks to explore the representation of gender at a diachronic level, comparing representations across the three games, but is only answered when appropriate to the analysis. The findings of all four research questions ultimately suggest that gender is represented in a complex but problematic way. Typically, female characters are represented as magic-users, while male characters enact physical roles. A transitivity analysis revealed that although men tend to carry out actions and have actions done to them in (roughly) equal amounts, women tend to have actions done upon them considerably more frequently. Further, the player's choice can impact upon the kinds of gendered representations encountered in the game, although this can be the result of unexpected events occurring as a result of certain choices. Thus, the player has less control over the narratives, despite appearing to be able to influence them. Throughout, I demonstrate the fruitful nature of using corpus linguistic methods on this data and ultimately call for more critical analyses of videogames via corpus methods.},

The location and quality of the shows are relevant for these reasons, along with the various sorts of personal interactions between the audience and performers. While some of these interactions resemble personal or human ones, the characteristics and scale of exchange that the platform enables, with thousands of viewers connected at the same time demanding the attention of one performer, require new technologies of assistance that involve humans and software---and some entanglements in between. Those technologies are located in the tension of generating value by accelerating exchanges while preserving the attributes that give them value in the first place.

  abstract = {In this paper the authors argue that games have not yet lived up to their potential in acting as compelling engines for moral or ethical reflection. Despite the prevalence of moral choice systems within games, modern titles currently lack the nuance and sophistication required to permit insight into anything meaningful regarding moral and immoral behaviour. The role games play in shaping moral outlooks is contentious and controversial. It is necessary to address this topic within a firm academic framework which we can use to understand the limits game developers have with regards to building emotionally resonant and morally complex games. To this end, the authors have reviewed the literature on the topics of morality and ethics in computer games with the intention of outlining this framework. While the narrative structure of games may offer opportunities for empathy and identification with player characters, the ludic requirements of balance serve to instantiate limits on both player agency and the viable set of actions. Within the context of games with a significant ethical component, these serve as the ideological limits within which moral context is bounded. Existing moral systems within games tend to adopt a perspective that is both binary and utilitarian, and the lack of real consequences for a player's choice imposes a shallowness on subsequent reflection. We discuss how this problem has been addressed to date within modern video games and evaluate the success of such endeavours. For games to truly meet their potential in this regard, it is necessary for them to offer something that is not present in other forms of literature. The nature of interactivity here offers some promise that players being made to enact rather than simply observe a choice will spur deeper consideration of the implications. This is predicated, however, on a sufficient level of player ownership of the actions a character takes. Current research on this topic is conflicted, and in the conclusion of the paper the authors outline a research agenda aimed at addressing this issue.},

Using an experimental design, the study investigates the relationship that exists between the effectiveness of in-game ad placements and a player's psychological experiences in reaction to the content of the game. It is argued that the numerous emotions and experiences that occur during game play (e.g. enjoyment, competence, tension) might have an impact on how players process the game environment, including in-game ads. In order to test this, a between-subjects online experiment was conducted in which participants played a casual PC game that contained several in-game advertisements. We manipulated the difficulty of the game, leading to differences in several player experiences between experimental conditions. Results indicate that increasing game difficulty affects the processing and evaluation of the brands featured in in-game ad placements both directly and, more importantly, indirectly through the variation of player experiences.},

Applications of these systems have been plagued by persistent inaccuracies in their output; these are often called ``AI hallucinations''. We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.},

We first review evidence for a basic building block of shared-reality creation: sharing-is-believing, whereby communicators tune their descriptions to align with their communication partner's attitude about something, which in turn shapes their recall. Next, we describe recent developments moving beyond this basic building block to explore generalized shared reality about the world at large, which promotes interpersonal closeness and epistemic certainty. Together, this body of work exemplifies the synergy between relational and epistemic motives. Finally, we discuss the potential for another form of shared reality---shared relevance---to bridge disparate realities.},

In contrast to our own world, the rulers, kings, and presidents of speculative games are often the most powerful individuals personally or physically, not just systemically. I employ political theorists Claude Lefort and Eric Santner to argue that the utilization of this trope allows audiences to safely engage with tensions and uncomfortable affects which are inherent to life in a democracy. Fighting bosses which are both monarch and the most powerful of their faction allows audiences to smooth frustrations with the symbolic and discursive chaos which often pervades democratic life. I examine one boss, Godrick the Grafted of Elden Ring, as a particularly fascinating example of this dynamic. I employ close readings of character dialogue and design to argue that such games serve a more concretized political function than scholars have identified.},

Data from 427 Vietnamese MMOGs players reveal that sense of virtual community not only directly impacts non-functional purchase intentions but also mediates the relationship between community identification and these intentions. Additionally, the image of the virtual community emerges as the most significant factor influencing community identification, compared with the other two factors sense of belonging and social support, highlighting its key role in shaping player behavior. Self-presentation motivations were found to mediate the effects of community dynamics on non-functional purchases.

I argue that Owen's main target is a number of poets, including Jessie Pope and Henry Newbolt, who recruited sanitized receptions of the classics to exhort young men to lay down their lives for their country. However, it is not clear that any of these, or Horace himself, is actually lying. Owen as a keen student of Roman and Greek culture employed classical themes in various poems. Although classical literature offered rich and nuanced conceptions of warfare, its emphasis on the supererogatory and named individual heroes meant that new conceptions of heroism needed to be developed in World War I to cope with the conditions of often anonymous industrialized trench warfare, in which even doing one's duty could seem heroic.},

  abstract = {This dissertation examines consumer perceptions of the engagement practices of the AAA video game industry, consumer perceptions of engagement with the AAA video game industry, and consumer perceptions of engagement with other consumers. Engagement is a strategic function encouraging organizational relationships with consumers. Though industries may develop approaches for engaging their consumers, these engagement practices may not match consumer perceptions and expectations., thus creating expectation gaps. Moreover, expectations of different consumer groups may be mutually exclusive. As industries continue to seek ways to engage consumers, engagement practices can present opportunities and risks. The dissertation consists of three separate studies. Study One examines self-identified casual, average, and hardcore video game consumers' perceptions of ideal engagement with AAA publishers, attitudes toward publishers, the likelihood of engaging with AAA publishers, and their consumer behaviors. Study Two examines the promotional texts produced by AAA publishers and journalist critiques of three negatively-reviewed video games. These video games are Electronic Arts' Mass Effect: Andromeda (2017) and Star Wars Battlefront II (2017), and, in collaboration with Sony Interactive Entertainment, Hello Games' No Man's Sky (2016). Qualitative analysis identifies issues evidenced in these texts in order to describe how engagement is enacted by publishers and how this engagement is evaluated by journalists. Finally, Study Three examines consumer-to-consumer conversations concerning the three negatively reviewed games on the social media platform Reddit. Findings for Study One indicate gamer type plays a role in how respondents engage with and perceive the video game industry as well as how they perceive engagement with other consumers. Study Two demonstrates how engagement strategies in promotional materials varied between the poorly-reviewed games. Journalistic critics referred to information in the promotional material to illustrate and evaluate publisher-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer engagement. Finally, Study Three produced insights into the contents of conversations between gamers on platform Reddit. The observed conversational themes contradicted journalist descriptions and evaluations of consumer-to-consumer engagement. Overall, these three studies work together to contribute and extend engagement theory by helping researchers and practitioners alike understand how a presumably active consumer group, such as video game consumers, engage with businesses and other consumers.},

Players are cast in the role of hunters in a hostile land, probing the shadowy city of Yharnam in search of "paleblood." The game achieved iconic status as both a horror and an action title for its rich lore and for the continuity of story elements through all aspects of game design. This first full-length study examines Bloodborne's themes of dangerous knowledge and fatal pride and its aesthetics in the context other works on game studies, horror and the Gothic. The book's three parts focus on lore and narrative, the game's nightmarish world, and its mechanics."--},

Emily Wilson employs elemental, resonant language and an iambic pentameter to produce a translation with an enchanting "rhythm and rumble" that avoids proclaiming its own grandeur. An engrossing tale told in a compelling new voice that allows contemporary readers to luxuriate in Homer's descriptions and similes and to thrill at the tension and excitement of its hero's adventures, Wilson recaptures what is "epic" about this wellspring of world literature.},

Intensity foregrounds the different degrees in which participants involve themselves in a craft, and also the elements of time, effort, and affectivity. Using game modification as a case study, the article analyzes how automated, computerized systems of evaluations, embedded into webpages, can create grounds for a self-understanding of productive abilities. Maneuvering through the three registers of industry, websites, and game modders, it examines the discourses of evaluative systems and details how participants use these technologies to self-manage and calibrate their labor. Interviews showed that the increasingly competitive drive for optimal standards of production comes at a cost to the well-being of participants. Studies of labor therefore need to consider the ``intense'' aspect of participatory production, and the impact it may have on its participants.},

  abstract = {Games borrow ceaselessly from the past to constitute themselves. This locates the medium at the heart of our contemporary obsession with how to engage the past and the ``real.'' In tethering digital hyperreality to the horizon of history, myth, and ritual, games generate a disavowed and subjunctive engagement with a sense of ``real enough.'' They thus resemble Victor Turner's liminoids: autotelic, bounded experiences of leisure that cultivate accepting yet playful attitudes against the ``real enough'' on offer. This commercialized bricolage is not dismissible as inauthentic simulacrum. Rather, such games demonstrate the ways in which new media are recalibrating our modes of engagement with the real. This article analyzes three key aspects of liminoid games: (1) techniques of reappropriation during production, (2) rules and expectations of engagement with the past and the ``real'' that games offer, and (3) emergent ways in which player communities, discourses, and productions recalibrate those politics of engagement.},

  abstract = {This dissertation proposes a new model for the critical interpretation of narrative games. The question of the relationship between narrative and games has been a hot topic in the field of game studies since its inception (Aarseth 1997; Murray 1997) and the so-called ludology vs. narratology debate (Eskelinen 2001; Juul 2001; Aarseth 2004). This has pushed the study of narrative games to occupy an awkward middle-ground. On the one hand, while there has been much said about the design of narrative games (Jenkins 2004; Fern\'andez-Vara 2011; Isbister 2016), the issue of critical interpretation has been left to languish, to the extent that even those scholars who are interested in interpreting the narratives of narrative games (Patterson 2015; Lucat 2017) rely on theories and models that ignore or dismiss narrative, notably Bogost's (2008) procedural rhetoric. But how precisely do we go about analyzing the narrative of narrative games? There is a need for a more enduring and systematic approach to the criticism and interpretation of narrative games that allows us to gain a deeper understanding of them and the effects that they are having on how we live our lives. Off of the back of an extended hermeneutic and ontological review of narrative games, this dissertation will propose the concept of the quest as a methodological tool for critical analysis. It will argue that the quest is a major meaning-making unit (Bogost 2006) in narrative games because it acts as the glue that binds non-narrative gameplay and narrative cinematics into contiguous and discrete sections (Howard 2008). Furthermore, as a discrete and identifiable unit, the quest serves as a practical approach to breaking otherwise enormous games into manageable chunks for analysis. Based on these theoretical and practical perspectives, this dissertation will develop the Questing Model for Narrative Game Analysis and Criticism, which will be utilized to perform an analysis of CDPR's Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt (Tomaszkiewicz et al 2015). We will conclude with some reflections on the applicability of the model in game studies and beyond. The structure of the dissertation is as follows: chapter 1 will introduce and contextualize the thesis. Chapter 2 will then note that before criticism we need hermeneutics, the study of interpretation, in order to understand and ground our own critical standards. With the goal of generating the hermeneutical principles that will guide the rest of the study, we will conduct areview of the criticism and analysis of games in both popular and academic literature. Starting from the ludology vs. narratology debate, it will look at various models (Fern\'andez-Vara 2009; Mukherjee 2015; Thabet 2015) for analyzing narrative games; game hermeneutics (M\"oring 2013; Arjoranta 2015) will be especially useful for us. At the end of the chapter we will have three hermeneutical principles with which to move forward. Having defined our hermeneutical principles, the next stage of our critical project is to turn to the object of study itself. Therefore, the goal of chapter 3 will be: what is a narrative game? Combining literary studies (Metz 1974; Chatman 1978; Genette 1983) and game studies (Ryan 2006; Aarseth 2012), we shall offer a definition that identifies the quest as a defining feature of the narrative game. This will lead us to a deeper examination of the quest, in chapter 4, where we will compare the ludic quest (Tronstad 2001; Tosca 2003; Aarseth 2005) to its literary forebears (Campbell 1949; Frye 1957) to produce a definition and typology of the former. Following this definitional groundwork, in chapter 5 we shall to deliver the Questing model. We operationalize the theories and definitions of previous chapters to derive several constituent ``signpost'' elements: events space, accessibility, time, characters, and limits. We discuss how these signpost elements point the way towards potential meaning, and examine in detail the different pathways for study and potential outcomes of each element. This will take us to chapter 6, where we put the model into action with an analysis of the Witcher 3. Using the Questing model, we will hypothesize that the Witcher 3 is a game that presents a complex picture of family, especially as regards to what constitutes good caregiving. We will systematically analyze different quests from the main storyline to demonstrate the validity of this point, drawing evidence from the game through our signpost elements to build our claims. Finally, in chapter 7 we will conclude the dissertation by reviewing what we have written, reflecting on the implications of our research, and ruminating on implications for the future of narrative game analysis and game studies more broadly.},

In these topics, a piece of misleading advice could cause harmful repercussions. In response to people's growing interest in using ChatGPT as a relationship advisor, our research evaluates ChatGPT's proficiency in discerning relationship advice. Specifically, we investigate its alignment with human judgements. We conducted our analysis with 13,138 Reddit posts about intimate relationship problems to examine the overall alignment. Furthermore, we investigate ChatGPT's consistency in judging intimate relationship advice by re-prompting identical queries. Our results indicate a significant disparity between ChatGPT and human judgments, with the model displaying inconsistency in its own decisions. Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive insights into ChatGPT's mechanisms for intimacy problems and future improvements in its proficiency in helping people's relationship struggles.},

I understand its aesthetical value---the imperative to scrounge together enough sustenance for basic survival, especially in the early game. However the more I played and more I discovered, the less novel it became, and the lofty rhetoric surrounding the game only made this dissatisfaction harder to swallow. ``Get lost!'', ``Turn off the HUD!'', ``Figure it out yourself!'' and contradictorily ``It's the first `real' Zelda adventure, the other games were only legends, man'' against ``C'mon grandma break out the graph paper, it's exactly like Zelda 1!'' You've got total and absolute freedom to carve your own path\dots{} unless you go somewhere too cold or too hot or too windy or too rainy or come across an enemy too strong or, most damningly, don't really love doing most of the 152 shrines littered across the map.

  abstract = {"What is a videogame? What makes a videogame "good"? If a game is supposed to be fun, can it be fun without a good story? If another is supposed to be an accurate simulation, does it still need to be entertaining? With the ever-expanding explosion of new videogames and new developments in the gaming world, questions about videogame criticism are becoming more complex. The differing definitions that players and critics use to decide what a game is and what makes a game successful, often lead to different ideas of how games succeed or fail. This collection of essays puts on display the variety and ambiguity of videogames. Each essay is a work of game criticism that takes a different approach to defining the game and analyzing it. Through analysis and critical methods, these essays discuss whether a game is defined by its rules, its narrative, its technology, or by the activity of playing it, and the tensions between these definitions. With essays on Overwatch, Dark Souls 3, Far Cry 4, Farmville and more, this collection attempts to show the complex changes, challenges and advances to game criticism in the era of videogames"-- Provided by publisher},

The way in which AI is affected varies across different games; games within the same genre often share multiple statistics and values, and these can be applied to an NPC in order to make the game easier or harder. Games within the First-Person Shooter (FPS) genre, for example, can always affect their difficulty by changing an enemy character's accuracy with weapons or overall damage output as these would all change how likely they are to defeat the player in a combat scenario. In this document, we will be detailing the development and structure of the multiple input Mamdani styled fuzzy inference system (FIS) that we developed in order to rate a given NPC's difficulty based on the rankings they have been given for these shared statistics.},

  abstract = {Over the past half century the mass media, including video games, have become important socializers of children. Observational learning theory has evolved into social--cognitive information processing models that explain that what a child observes in any venue has both short-term and long-term influences on the child's behaviors and cognitions. C. A. Anderson et al.'s (2010) extensive meta-analysis of the effects of violent video games confirms what these theories predict and what prior research about other violent mass media has found: that violent video games stimulate aggression in the players in the short run and increase the risk for aggressive behaviors by the players later in life. The effects occur for males and females and for children growing up in Eastern or Western cultures. The effects are strongest for the best studies. Contrary to some critics' assertions, the meta-analysis of C. A. Anderson et al. is methodologically sound and comprehensive. Yet the results of meta-analyses are unlikely to change the critics' views or the public's perception that the issue is undecided because some studies have yielded null effects, because many people are concerned that the implications of the research threaten freedom of expression, and because many people have their identities or self-interests closely tied to violent video games.},

And yet, until now, Foucault's work has attracted only fleeting attention from the legal academy. Foucault and Law corrects this oversight. Opening with a lucid, critical and unpretentious account of Foucault's work, Hunt and Wickham map out a terrain of methodological and theoretical principals, providing the groundwork for a new sociology of law as governance.},

Barthes's concise analyses of contemporary French culture and accompanying theoretical essay had a profound influence on a variety of fields, including design studies. For design critics and practitioners alike, Mythologies helped shape an understanding of how designed artifacts operate in a mass consumer culture: less as functional objects and more as metaphoric vehicles of collective desire. Barthes's critical interventions are particularly pertinent in the early twenty-first century as a provocative inter-disciplinary model for contemporary design studies. This article begins with a discussion of Barthes's intellectual foundations for Mythologies and a consideration of the work in its original context. It then adapts Barthes' techniques in order to examine the myth of global digital determinism embodied in the recent One Laptop per Child project.},

In MA, players' choices of high or low calorie snacks impact visual appearance of their monster avatar. MA utilizes two types of health messages: subversive, which encourages players to make unhealthy choices and focuses on costs, and inoculation, which encourages players to eventually defend healthy choices and focuses on benefits. We test message framing's effect by tracking users' purchasing behavior in our online snack shop, Snackazon. The study showed that when positive messages were embedded in MA mixed with negative visuals through the monster avatars, participants exhibited better snack choices post-gameplay.},

Summary     World of Warcraft Classic (a version of the game how it was at the end of 2006) was released in the August of 2019 to overwhelming success. Many people in the World of Warcraft gaming community advocated for this version of the game to be released, however, it is unclear how much the community affected the decision to release this version of the game. This exploratory netnographic study aimed to discover the extent to which the community affected the release of World of Warcraft Classic. The study was conducted by analyzing four Reddit threads and two YouTube videos on the topic with the help of Atlas.ti qualitative research software.     Conclusions    The results of the study indicated that community interactions with Activision Blizzard had likely influenced the release of World of Warcraft Classic. However, the determination of the extent of this influence proved not to be possible in this study, due to the lack of available information.

We applied the breakdown/breakthrough "lens" to explore how players attempt to achieve breakthroughs in relation to two single player games. We identified a finite number of strategies that illustrate how players learn in games. These strategies are considered in relation to producing playable and engaging games.},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that player involvement can be influenced by a range of factors, from the controllers used to the perceived level of challenge provided by the game. However, little attention has been paid to the influence of the game interface. Game interfaces consist of both diegetic (that can be viewed by the player-character, e.g. the game world) and non-diegetic components (that are only viewed by the player, e.g. the heads-up display). In this paper we examine two versions of a first-person shooter game to investigate how immersion is influenced through interacting with a diegetic and non-diegetic interface. Our findings suggest that the removal of non-diegetic elements, such as the heads-up display, is able to influence immersion in expert players through increasing their cognitive involvement and sense of control. We argue that these results illustrate the importance of considering the role of expertise in relation to how particular design choices will influence the player experience.},

  abstract = {In 2021, the United States was the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases globally (after China, whose population was then over four times larger). The scale and urgency of the problem has been broadcasted for years, but the necessity and methods of dealing with it on a national and individual level seem to be quite obscure. Recycling is not the norm, oil and meat consumption is high, and excess spending is common. Consumption is still seen and presented as the means of satisfying most of one's needs as well as a necessary condition for achieving a high social status. Dealing with climate change, as much as materially possible, involves dealing with the specificity of American geopolitics and culture: among other factors, its post-Protestant views on money and poverty, imperial position, and extreme individualism.  The expansion pack The Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle, produced by California-based Electronic Arts, fits into the consumerist approach to climate change popular in the United States. Eco Lifestyle introduces air pollution, recycling, living off -grid, and local politics, as well as the styles and activities related to pro-environmental attitudes. However, these activities are stripped of their material sense, as the actions depicted in the game are not what limits emissions and carbon footprint in the real world. This seems to be more a strategy than an error; and yet, it is hard not to regret a missed opportunity of creating a playable and ecologically sound Sims expansion for the lovers of the gameworld---and the world.},

Replay story -- a game telling a story through choices and allowing the player to access all of their outcomes -- was supposed to be a step in the process of games becoming the most important narrative medium of a new era. Soon after that, the reasonable critique emerged: not every story can, and should, be told through a replay story. Some, mostly tragic ones, can even be highly controversial if told in such form. However, new ways of storytelling through replay have emerged in recent years: New Game +, multiple routes that influence one another, and games that are conscious of previous playthroughs. Three years ago, Ian Bogost stated that the possibilities of development of narrative games had already been played out, and yet, there still is a chance that replay story can once again be considered a keystone in the evolution of games.},

GenAI has the potential to support and automate some of the cognitive skills considered essentially human, such as analytic problem solving, planning, and creativity. While the promise of increased productivity, efficiency, and accuracy is appealing, such extensive adoption begs the question: What is the cost of outsourcing cognitive tasks to GenAI? When does aid become substitution, and what is the long-term impact of doing this continuously? Like muscles atrophy without stimulus, research has indicated that cognitive skills deteriorate if not regularly exercised. Researchers globally are still discovering the task-specific benefits and adverse consequences of deploying GenAI in various knowledge work processes, but no one yet knows the long-term impact of using GenAI to support cognitive processes, and we have limited technological antecedents to rely on. This position paper provides a mapping of existing research and synthesizes it into an outline of potential long-term risk areas for cognition of using GenAI in knowledge work.},

The Hague Peace Conference of 1899, in its Final Act, expressed the wish that a special conference be convened for the revision of the Geneva Convention of 1864. In 1906 this conference was organized by the Swiss Government and attended by 35 States. On the basis of proposals submitted to it by the International Committee of the Red Cross the conference adopted the new Convention which replaced the 1864 Convention in the relations between the Contracting States. With 33 articles divided into eight chapters, the Convention of 1906 is more detailed and more precise in its terminology than the Convention of 1864. New provisions were included concerning the burial of the dead and the transmission of information. The voluntary aid societies were for the first time expressly recognized. On the other hand, provisions which had proved to be impracticable were changed. The prerogatives of the inhabitants bringing help to the wounded were reduced to more reasonable proportions, and the duty to repatriate the wounded who are unfit for further service was transformed into a mere recommendation. The Convention of 1906 was replaced by the Geneva Convention of 1929, but remained in force until 1970, when the last State party to it which had not yet adhered to one of the later Conventions (Costa Rica) acceded to the Conventions of 1949.},

  abstract = {Intergenerational trauma is a discrete form of trauma which occurs when traumatic effects are passed across generations without exposure to the original event. This qualitative study aimed to explore how psychiatrists understand intergenerational trauma in respect to their practice, for the purposes of identifying interventions for addressing intergenerational trauma in public mental health services. Findings revealed that psychiatrists observe intergenerational trauma frequently in their roles and try to opportunistically promote awareness of trauma with adults, and refer families to external services for supportive interventions. They feel powerless when faced with directly intervening with intergenerational trauma and required restructuring of their roles to adequately address it in public settings. Findings have implications for training, advocacy and research on the relationship between trauma and mental illness. Alongside this, there is an indicated need for examination of how systems can ensure access to appropriate services once organisations become trauma-informed.},

  abstract = {It is widely agreed that digital games are dual structures, comprised of both a mechanistic and a semiotic dimension. While early approaches tended to favor one of these elements on behalf of the other, much current research calls for more holistic approaches to digital games which take both dimensions into account. Still, existing analytical frameworks dedicated to analyzing digital games as aesthetic works tend to have either a very general focus or to mainly address meaning or mechanisms.  Here a broad notion of challenge is proposed as a basis for holistic analysis of digital games. Conceptualizing challenge both as demanding and stimulating situations which may be identified as potential or actualized in a given playing, the offered framework is demonstrated through application in an analysis of Fallout 3. Seeking to take into account the premise of situated playing, the analysis will focus on the interplay between the game's expressivity and mechanics in creating a plethora of varied potential challenges and, likewise, the ways these may be actualized for a given player.},

Both the books and the game are popular cultural expressions of a Christian theology that posits an apocalyptic future in which humanity will be finally judged. Drawing on both narratology and ludology, the paper suggests that the Left Behind Game is neither truly a narrative nor a game. Instead a maze like structure can be identified. This structure allows the player a number of choices within the game play, but only one pathway allows the player to successfully navigate the game. Furthermore, there is only a single successful resolution. The paper concludes that this game structure is homologous to the theological structure of the apocalyptic belief system.},

It focuses on stylistic relations between some of the game's text assets and their literary source material, as the game is based on a fantasy series by a Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Firstly, it presents a brief characteristic of the localization process and its different models which were applied in this particular case and then it focuses on the distinguishing marks of the author's writing style. Thereafter, it is illustrated with examples how the three linguistic versions of the game transfer the distinguished linguistic features in order to conclude which one of the language versions and localization models can be considered more suitable for preserving the source material style.},

Eschewing the arid secularities of philosophy, Walter Benjamin once recommended the alternative of the rich figurality of an older theology; in that spirit we here return to the antiquated Ptolemaic systems of ancient allegory and its multiple levels (a proposal first sketched out in The Political Unconscious); it is tested against the epic complexities of the overtly allegorical works of Dante, Spenser and the Goethe of Faust II, as well as symphonic form in music, and the structure of the novel, postmodern as well as Third World: about which a notorious essay on National Allegory is here reprinted with a theoretical commentary; and an allegorical history of emotion is meanwhile rehearsed from its contemporary, geopolitical context.},

Throughout the historical periods, argues Jameson, the question of narrative persists through its multople format changes and metamophoses.},

Representing the collaboration of ten expert researchers of Japanese popular culture and travel, it develops a theoretical framework for understanding war-related contents tourism and demonstrates the framework in practice via numerous short case studies across a millennium of warfare in Japan including: the tales of heroic deities in the Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters, AD 712), the Edo poetry of Matsuo Basho, and the Pacific war through lens of popular media such as the animated film the Grave of the Fireflies.

Weaving together insights about spatiality in digital games from (ecocritical and postcolonial) game studies, as well as performance studies, the paper problematizes some of the most basic elements of digital games in general: navigation and movement. It then moves to a discussion of the "Frostfall" mod as one possible option to counteract the destructive and oppositional relationship between the player and nature in Skyrim. "Frostfall" is an ecomod that adds weather survival elements to the game, by which the player can freeze and die from hypothermia if they do not take the appropriate measures to cope with Skyrim's harsh climate. In this way, the power fantasy set up in the base game becomes somewhat limited, as the player's agency encounters nature's newfound agency and must find ways to negotiate the gameworld while taking seriously the environment as an agent in and of that gameworld.},

With many developers insisting that their games are not political in any way, and with recent games desperately trying to say as little as possible about their subject matter, many critics find that there is once again a need to stress this point. The ability to be political stretches across genres and settings, though some genres and settings lend themselves to being seen as more overtly political than others. For instance, criticising racialised depictions in games set in the `real world', like Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series, is often quite straightforward, especially given the shallowness and harsh stereotyping these depictions usually entail (Dyer-Witheford \& De Peuter, 2009, p. 164-70; Gray, 2014, p. 24-26). This is hardly surprising in an industry in which creators are expected to use established media types for their characters, such as ``gangsters, rappers, martial artists, and the like'', without reflecting on the fact that these types are often racially coded, even if the game in question seeks to avoid ``real races and cultural moments'' (Isbister, 2006, p. 60-61).},

I see fannish discussions surrounding the canonical status of several works within the universe as an entry point into one of the most important underlying controversies of The Elder Scrolls as a shared idea between its fans; that is, the tension between the `universe-as-games' and the `universe-as-texts'. Some fans give primacy to the written texts found within the universe, and neglect the universe-as-games in their world-building discussions. Consequentially, The Imperial Library's paratextual functioning and overt emphasis on texts come to strengthen the position of the universe-as-texts in relation to the universe-as-games.},

Without doubt, Halo is widely considered to be a remarkable game. Why is that? Halo takes a little from here (Half-life, driving games) and a little from there (Doom, Battlezone), and mixes these ingredients into an enjoyable and polished whole. It doesn't really introduce any single, new game technique or design gimmick. Does this, acknowledging but dismissing the inevitable marketing hype, warrant it being called "the best game ever" or "the most important launch game for any console, ever" (EDGE \#105)? This review aims to show that "the best game in its genre so far" might be closer to truth. Planet First Person Shooter with its Quakesauruses has been hit by a meteorite called Halo.

This method also yields an approach to the contentious topic of video game narrative which may particularly recommend it to literary scholars with an interest in the form.

Our framework combines public API performance data with region-specific environmental multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank models by performance relative to environmental cost. Our results show that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 emerge as the most energy-intensive models, consuming over 33 Wh per long prompt, more than 70 times the consumption of GPT-4.1 nano, and that Claude-3.7 Sonnet ranks highest in eco-efficiency. While a single short GPT-4o query consumes 0.43 Wh, scaling this to 700 million queries/day results in substantial annual environmental impacts. These include electricity use comparable to 35,000 U.S. homes, freshwater evaporation matching the annual drinking needs of 1.2 million people, and carbon emissions requiring a Chicago-sized forest to offset. These findings illustrate a growing paradox: Although AI is becoming cheaper and faster, its global adoption drives disproportionate resource consumption. Our study provides a standardized, empirically grounded methodology for benchmarking the sustainability of LLM deployments, laying a foundation for future environmental accountability in AI development and sustainability standards.},

  abstract = {Joseph Campbell's classical monomyth claims to describe a universal human narrative: the hero's journey. For decades, it has commanded a revered position in American literary theory, global media production, and the world of videogames. Although the monomyth is still one of the few recognized approaches to videogame writing, there have been few critical examinations of it as a dominant design paradigm. This article therefore interrogates the power dynamics of monomythic videogames, especially concerning authoritarian agencies in the `world savior' model of many AAA titles. Understanding authoritarianism as an agentic modality of gameplay, the study uses an assemblage-based approach that encompasses the agencies of popular designs and their embedded ideologies; labor conditions of videogame production; gaming culture; political contexts; monomyth- and authoritarianism-saturated media landscapes; exertions of nonhuman actors and player's subjectivities. To illustrate the patterns of authoritarian modalities in world-savior videogames, I conduct an analysis of Horizon Zero Dawn as an exemplary case study. Finally, I turn to gaming culture for evidence of the potentials that these videogames have to nourish authoritarian sensibilities, highlighting the parallel authoritarian agencies of heroic gameplay and harassment campaigns like GamerGate.},

Despite this focus, there remains a crucial absence of consensus over the diagnostic criteria of video game addiction. Currently both psychological and behavioral interventions regard screen time as an indicator of video game addiction. However, these interventions are challenged by substantial literature that increasingly regard time to not be a predictor of addiction. To build onto the work that has been done, this paper argues that time is an inadequate criterion in which to ascertain video game addiction, proposing that a physiological-based criteria be used in conjunction with contextualized understandings of video game dynamics to approach video game addiction. This realignment is all the more pressing as video games begin a transition from a leisure activity to its current orientation as a viable career option.},

From Little Britain 's Vicky Pollard to the demonization of Jade Goody, media and politicians alike dismiss as feckless, criminalized and ignorant a vast, underprivileged swathe of society whose members have become stereotyped by one, hate-filled word: chavs. In this groundbreaking investigation, Owen Jones explores how the working class has gone from salt of the earth to scum of the earth. Exposing the ignorance and prejudice at the heart of the chav caricature, one based on the media's inexhaustible obsession with an indigent white underclass, he portrays a far more complex reality. Moving through Westminster's lobbies and working-class communities from Dagenham to Dewsbury Moor, Jones reveals the increasing poverty and desperation of communities made precarious by wrenching social and industrial change, and all but abandoned by the aspirational, society-fragmenting policies of Thatcherism and New Labour. The chav stereotype, he argues, is used by governments as a convenient figleaf to avoid genuine engagement with social and economic problems, and to justify widening inequality. Based on a wealth of original research, and wide-ranging interviews with media figures, political opinion-formers and workers, Chavs is a damning indictment of the media and political establishment, and an illuminating, disturbing portrait of inequality and class hatred in modern Britain.},

Accordingly, four video games localized by Darinoos, the most prominent Iranian game localization company, were selected; their textual materials were extracted and compiled into a corpus of 3068 source--target pairs. The results showed Copying Structure is the most frequently used solution indicating the prominence of word-for-word translation. Cultural Correspondence, on the other hand, was revealed to have received the lowest proportion suggesting the lack of creativity and failure to transfer culture-specific language. The findings revealed several inadequacies in video game localization into Persian, which are explored within the cultural and industrial settings of Iran.},

The analysis aims to demonstrate how sophisticated narrative features can be integrated in gameplay through the development of interesting characters. Using a comparative analysis, the author shows that the two games' have different approaches to using characters as narrative tools within the same genre, while also incorporating these narrative features tightly into gameplay. Central to the argument is the idea that presenting the player as protagonist is not necessarily the most fruitful approach to narrative experiences in games, and that narrative coherence may be better established and maintained through letting non-player characters carry the weight of narrative progression.},

  address = {Copenhagen, Denmark},
  abstract = {Computer games and board games alike are cultural artifacts that reflect the ideas of their creators and the society in which they are embedded and played. Like cinema and literature, they may represent more or less familiar environments, events and beings. That said, there are great differences between these media, which also affects how they can be understood as representational artifacts. In addition to this, when considering a game such as Tetris, it is not even given that games represent in the first place. This raises the question of what it is that makes us consider games as representational artifacts and subsequently, which representational capacities, or better, meaning-producing capacities and practices we may associate with them? Furthermore, to what extend are games a medium and how do they relate to other media? This dissertation reviews theories of representation and their application to game analysis. Based on these theories, I propose a media-centered, and materialist framework for conceptualizing and analyzing games as simulations. With this, I will address games as objects, consisting of a multimodal surface expression that is governed by an underlying mechanical structure and realized in a material medium. The framework describes the basic qualities of a given game through what I call the material, structural, communicational and agential modalities. I will discuss the ways in which simulations refer to a target, a relationship which I argue is not intrinsic to the simulation itself, but remains relative to interpretation. Consequently, the study of representation should not only consider the game artifact in itself, but also the context in which it is produced and consumed. Therefore, the analysis will progress from the relatively formal analysis of games as simulations to a discussion of games as cultural artifacts that are discursively constructed as what I call qualified media. These qualified media have evolved side by side with other media, and are governed by a set of normative assumptions about what games are, what they should look like, how they should be played and by whom. Finally, the dissertation will offer a demonstration of the proposed framework in an analysis of the ways in which gender is represented in the computer game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. This analysis will first consider the formal elements of the game, that is the material, structural, visual and textual aspects and how they are put into operation by a player. Next, the case study situates the game and its construction of gender in a broader cultural context in which games intersect with other media and are produced and consumed according to certain cultural conventions and norms.},

By selecting three companies in Finland, Norway and Sweden, we look at the transition from subculture into formal companies. The study is informed by an oral history approach, supplemented by a variety of other sources, including industry reports, mainstream press stories and online materials. The article argues that the presence of the demoscene in the Nordic region had an influence on the game companies, but the transition from hobbyism to professional work processes was not straightforward or simple. However, without the demoscene, the game companies would have had a difficult time finding interested and qualified employees.},

Ellestr\"om's framework allows us to address games as particular tangible objects in the world in a way that avoids normative assumptions about games in general as well as specific types of games such as digital or analog games. This framework has several usages. It can be applied in an analysis the relationship between different modalities in a single game; it can be used to compare different games; and finally, it can be used to discuss the similarities and differences between games and other media objects.},

This paper adds nuance to this discussion through two arguments. First, we argue that videogames cannot be understood as mainly expressive or interactive, but that these characteristics must be understood in tandem if we are to understand the role of videogames in culture and society, connected by the player. Second, we argue that play and playfulness are ignored in debates about videogames and the freedom of expression, and that attention towards the playful aspects offers a better view of how videogames differ from other media and what this means for the status of expressions in videogames.},

In our analysis of official and unofficial YouTube content, the role and desires of advertisers were discussed in depth. Community commentary videos publicly argued that YouTube cared about advertisers more than a content creating community; marketing-orientated entrepreneurial growth content advised creators to pursue a `buying audience'; and YouTube's official communications painstakingly reminded creators to `put themselves in advertisers' shoes'. Each of these perspectives contributes an understanding of the ways advertising structurally shapes the governance of cultural production in practice.},

The article dives deep into the history and political economy of battle royale shooters and the game Apex Legends (2019), a free-to-play example of the genre monetized in part by a battle pass. Inspired and in dialogue with Nieborg and Poell's (2018) theory of platformization, this article asks questions related to how digital games like this operationalize their status as `contingent commodities'. The article then engages in an `app walk-through' ( Light et al., 2018 ) of Apex Legends, analysing its vision, operating model and governance. The focus here is on revealing the `mediator characteristics' that structure in-game commodities like avatar skins, loot boxes and the battle pass. There is then a discussion and theorization of these monetization strategies and the industry-wide tendencies for consumerism they signal. A key takeaway is that digital consumption in games is at once both easy to `see' but also highly abstracted, making it very difficult to pull apart what people are actually consuming when they engage with the monetization layer of contemporary digital games.},

I put this crisis of play and work in dialogue with Harvey's concept of ``accumulation by dispossession,'' firmly placing it within a longer history of disruptive capital accumulation strategies. I then conduct a discourse analysis of community members on reddit, as they make sense of and come to terms with this process of dispossession. Arising in the discourse was not class consciousness per se, but instead a pervasive feeling of helplessness and frustration as games, play, and leisure began to feel like work.},

In the case of Mass Effect, the player and Commander Shepard are seen as normates, defined in opposition to Joker and the supercrip. The supercrip character allows the able-bodied to view disability as something other than physical suffering. This essay argues that Joker is a character designed for the able-bodied player; he compensates for his disability through humor and his unmatched ability to fly the Normandy. The Normandy acts as Joker's prosthesis. As a supercrip character, his prosthesis is a sign of empowerment and super-ability, rather than a reminder of his disability. However, the beings that inhabit the Mass Effect universe are all deeply reliant upon new technology, redefining the normate body as one that includes prosthesis, even while it defines Joker as Other. In Mass Effect 2, Joker's disability is all but cured. This paper examines how a cure for his disability allows Joker to take on the more traditional role of the hero figure that would not be possible for a disabled character.},

  abstract = {This article looks at the impact of video games on transmedia fantasy worlds using The Witcher as a primary example. While Hollywood-centred franchises tends to follow a ``mothership'' model of transmedia, with one dominant platform surrounded by ancillary texts, The Witcher demonstrates an alternate model in which the video game series plays just as central a role as the TV adaptation. The article introduces the concept of ``dual industrial core'' transmedia to describe this type of franchise and explains its implications for fantastic storyworlds. Whereas mothership transmedia attempts to offer high levels of completeness and consistency, particularly in relation to the storyworld's mythos and topos, dual industrial core transmedia favours greater flexibility. The key platforms for the storyworld maintain distinct differences between each other, often deliberately choosing to diverge in terms of character and storyworld representation, with the video game praised for its Slavic character while the TV series aims for a more generic fantasy environment reminiscent of Game of Thrones or The Lord of the Rings. What holds the fantasy world together is less a coherent mythos and topos than a particular kind of ethos, allowing creators in different media to expand the storyworld by creating ``Witcher-esque'' situations that are accepted as authentic if they remain true to the storyworld's bleak, morally ambiguous worldview. As dual industrial core franchises become more common, we may also expect to see more fantastic storyworlds bound primarily by ethos with significantly less emphasis on a complete, consistent mythos and topos.},

  abstract = {Imitation Learning (IL) is a machine learning approach to learn a policy from a set of demonstrations. IL can be useful to kick-start learning before applying reinforcement learning (RL) but it can also be useful on its own, e.g. to learn to imitate human players in video games. Despite the success of systems that use IL and RL, how such systems can adapt in-between game rounds is a neglected area of study but an important aspect of many strategy games. In this paper, we present a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions. The outcome of this approach is a single neural network policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely modulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human demonstrations for the build-order planning task in StarCraft II. Dimensionality reduction is applied to construct a low-dimensional behavioral space from a high-dimensional description of the army unit composition of each human replay. The results demonstrate that the learned policy can be effectively manipulated to express distinct behaviors. Additionally, by applying the UCB1 algorithm, the policy can adapt its behavior - in-between games - to reach a performance beyond that of the traditional IL baseline approach.},

  abstract = {As questions go, this is not a bad one: Do games tell stories? Answering this should tell us both how to study games and who should study them. The affirmative answer suggests that games are easily studied from within existing paradigms. The negative implies that we must start afresh. But the answer depends, of course, on how you define any of the words involved. In this article, I will be examining some of the different ways to discuss this. Lest this turns into a battle of words (i.e. who has the right to define "narrative"), my agenda is not to save or protect any specific term, the basic point of this article is rather that we should allow ourselves to make distinctions. The operation of framing something as something else works by taking some notions of the source domain (narratives) and applying them to the target domain (games). This is not neutral; it emphasises some traits and suppresses others. Unlike this, the act of comparing furthers the understanding of differences and similarities, and may bare hidden assumptions. The article begins by examining some standard arguments for games being narrative. There are at least three common arguments: 1) We use narratives for everything. 2) Most games feature narrative introductions and back-stories. 3) Games share some traits with narratives. The article then explores three important reasons for describing games as being non-narrative: 1) Games are not part of the narrative media ecology formed by movies, novels, and theatre. 2) Time in games works differently than in narratives. 3) The relation between the reader/viewer and the story world is different than the relation between the player and the game world. The article works with fairly traditional definitions of stories and narratives, so as a final point I will consider whether various experimental narratives of the 20th century can in some reconcile games and narratives.},

With new technology, haptics, rendering, virtual reality, we have spent much energy discussing immersion and presence, thinking sometimes about current technology, but often about hypothetical perfect experiences or future perfect technology. In this, we have forgotten something rather fundamental: How do we in the first place decide to see a group of pixels on a screen as an object to which we have access, rather than as a picture of an object? This paper explores this question through a playable essay. At first, we may think that we will identify anything interactive as an object, but the playable essay demonstrates that this is much more complex and pragmatic, and that this identification has three steps -- identifying pixels as an object rather than a picture, reasoning about the object as a specific type of object (such as a ball), and identifying it as a real instance of a type of object (such as a calculator). I conclude that we identify objects not with a general list of properties (like ``being interactive'' or ``physical''), but on implicit rules that we use depending on the type of object we are considering, and on what we are trying to do at a given time. I identify nine such tentative rules. Finally, there are many kinds of video game worlds, from the default 3D worlds of many game engines to social worlds. Examining the Unity3D engine used to create the game, I argue that game worlds are fundamentally not designed as bottom-up simulations of a world, but are deliberately implemented in human categories, and that we understand them as such. Within that frame, our relation to video game objects is pragmatic, and we will accept pixels as objects when it is helpful to our goals and plans.},

  abstract = {A venturesome hypothesis has been put forth by Wilson (1984), Kellert (1996), and others and has been receiving increasing support. The hypothesis asserts the existence of biophilia, a fundamental, genetically based human need and propensity to affiliate with other living organisms. A review of the biophilia literature sets into motion three overarching concerns. One focuses on the genetic basis of biophilia. A second focuses on how to understand seemingly negative affiliations with nature within the biophilic framework. A third focuses on the quality of supporting evidence and whether the biophilia hypothesis can be disconfirmed. Through this critical examination, biophilia emerges as a valuable interdisciplinary framework for investigating the human affiliation with nature. Yet it is clearly a nascent framework, and some of its potential lies in charting a stronger ontogenetic course. Toward this end, in the second half of this article a structural--developmental approach is framed for investigating biophilia. Support for this approach is provided by discussing the author's recent studies---conducted in the United States and in the Brazilian Amazon---on children's environmental reasoning and values.},

According to a 2006 survey, 58 percent of young people aged 15 to 25 were civically "disengaged," meaning that they participated in fewer than two types of either electoral activities (defined as voting, campaigning, etc.) or civic activities (for example, volunteering). Kahne and his coauthors are interested in what role video games may or may not play in this disengagement.Until now, most research in the field has considered how video games relate to children's aggression and to academic learning. Digital media scholars suggest, however, that other social outcomes also deserve attention. For example, as games become more social, some scholars argue that they can be important spheres in which to foster civic development. Others disagree, suggesting that games, along with other forms of Internet involvement, may in fact take time away from civic and political engagement. Drawing on data from the 2006 survey, the authors examine the relationship between video game play and civic development. They call for further research on teen gaming experiences so that we can understand and promote civic engagement through video games.},

This is characterised by a form of weapons fetishisation, by which the drone is deemed a supreme object of post-September 2001 conflicts. Such patriotism, as a consequence, is distorting. American citizens accused of committing terrorist attacks may be attacked and assassinated without due process. Constitutional protections are sidestepped, and justified on the basis of self-defence and the nature of the conflict. Accountability for such actions is thereby minimised.},

While studies of Victorian children's literature have drawn attention to the ways in which these books reflect and reproduce the racial ideologies associated with British imperialism, I contend that Victorian ``imperial innocence'' continues to haunt children's culture far beyond the temporal and geographical boundaries traditionally ascribed to the period. After World War II left Japan subject to the American occupation, Little Black Sambo became a runaway bestseller, prompting anti-Black racist imagery to proliferate in kawaii commodities. By tracing the book's afterlife in kawaii, I illustrate how Victorian children's fantasies have been transmuted into flexible signifiers of racial forgetting.},

  abstract = {This article explores the ties between anti-Black racist kitsch and kawaii culture through the history of the Dakko-chan doll. In what came to be called the ``Dakko-chan boom'' of 1960, tens of thousands of Japanese people lined up to purchase an inflatable blackface doll with a circular red mouth, grass skirt, and winking hologram eyes. Dakko means ``to hug,'' and Dakko-chan's astronomical popularity resulted in part from the way the doll could be worn as an accessory, attached to the body by its hugging arms. This article asks what it meant for Japan, a nation still recovering from World War II and the American occupation, to quite literally embrace American blackface in the form of an embraceable doll. Rejecting the claim that blackface loses its significance in a Japanese context, this article argues that Dakko-chan cannot be considered devoid of racist meanings. Emerging amid the political turmoil surrounding the revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty, Dakko-chan came to express a wide range of contradictory feelings about race, sex, and nation, illustrating how affective attachments to racist forms have accrued rather than dissipated through their movement into new cultural contexts.},

However, mediatization must be conceptualized as a cogent process whose impact extends beyond the confines of the ``media environment'' to the natural environment. We make this argument by reviewing how three dominant traditions of mediatization scholarship: (a) institutionalist, (b) cultural/social constructivist, and (c) materialist conceptualize ``the environment.'' We argue that scholars rarely acknowledge the materialist dimension of mediatization despite it being a fundamental aspect of mediatization processes. Consequently, we bring discourse surrounding the materiality of mediatization to the fore by drawing on theories of materiality from media and communication studies in general and highlighting three material dimensions of mediatization processes in particular: (a) resources, (b) energy, and (c) waste. In doing so, we make explicit the implicit material dimensions of mediatization processes that have been largely overlooked but are directly linked to how we understand, theorize and react to the societal, cultural, economic, environmental transformations brought about by media.},

The collection focuses on the ways in which gamers engage with, play with, recreate, subvert, reverse and direct the historical past, and what effect this has on the ways in which we go about constructing the present or imagining a future. What can World War Two strategy games teach us about the reality of this complex and multifaceted period? Do the possibilities of playing with the past change the way we understand history? If we embody a colonialist's perspective to conquer 'primitive' tribes in Colonization, does this privilege a distinct way of viewing history as benevolent intervention over imperialist expansion? The fusion of these two fields allows the editors to pose new questions about the ways in which gamers interact with their game worlds. Drawing these threads together, the collection concludes by asking whether digital games - which represent history or historical change - alter the way we, today, understand history itself"--},

Likewise, the objective of this study is to present the design and the development of an educational web application for learning the necessary steps towards the detection of bogus content, according to the fact-checking procedures. The game presents news articles, which have to be characterized as fake or real by the players. During the effort to reach the correct decision, the players can use tools and practices for identifying relevant information regarding the clues, which frame a news story (title, date, creator, source, containing images). After presenting the progress of interface design and development, this paper reports the results of a randomized online field study (n = 111), which provides some preliminary evidence. Specifically, it is validated that the game can raise awareness, teach about authentication tools, and highlight the importance of patterns that include evidence regarding the authenticity of articles. Additionally, thorough discussion was conducted within a media class (n = 35) to receive useful feedback/evaluation about the offered utilities and their usability. The findings suggest that educational games may be a promising vehicle to inoculate the public against misinformation.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the subversive potential of myths by exploring Margaret Atwood's feminist revision of creation, more specifically the myth of paradise. According to Adrienne Rich's definition, the ``re-vision'' of myths signifies the critical adaptation, appropriation, and invasion of traditional texts. As such, myths have not only legitimized exploitative power relationships, but they have also served as a powerful means to participate in and subvert hegemonic discourses. By drawing on the theories of Aby Warburg, Ernst Cassirer, and Hans Blumenberg, for whom myths constitute cultural-artistic mediations that involve the polarities of affect and intellect, terror and logos, Atwood's revision of paradise in the MaddAddam trilogy may be approached in itself as -- to use a term by Hans Blumenberg -- a ``work of logos.'' I argue that Atwood revises paradise by duplicating the ancient human dreams of paradise into Crake's techno pagan and Adam One's eco-millennialist ``gardens of delights,'' both of which are refracted through evolutionary science and ecology.Characterized by human destructiveness, these posthuman paradises feature multiple Eves alongside the dominant male figures. Among Atwood's Eves, there is the brazen Oryx as exploited racial ``Other'' of white society in the pathos formula of the Asian ``digital virgin prostitute.'' Atwood employs a self-reflexivity regarding myths that is characteristic of postmodern pastiche and thus highlights storytelling as the distinguishing characteristic of humankind, while her use of an evolutionary grotesque aesthetics erodes clear-cut distinctions between humans, animals, and post-humans. The myth of paradise, the trilogy suggests, is also always a myth of extinction.},

Contra posthumanist approaches which characterize videogames as an entangling of human and nonhuman agencies in democratic assemblages, this essay argues that videogames ought to be viewed as technical arrangements (apparatuses) which constitute their users as ``agents.'' Posthumanist theories, due to their elision of abstraction from their mapping of the world, miss this fundamental aspect of agency, which Ideology critique can effectively highlight. Following the work of French Philosopher Louis Althusser, this paper demonstrates that ideology is best understood not as a set of conscious beliefs, nor even merely as a set of ``representations'' in the way that Cultural Studies tends to discuss representations, but instead that Ideology is a technology which constitutes individual subjects, linking subjectivity to our technical being-in-the-world. In so doing, Ideology produces what we understand as ``agency.'' Ideology critique, when taken as far as it can go in this direction, offers game studies a fundamental starting point for videogame analysis: that videogames are sites of production in which corporeal movement becomes legible as a form of ``agency'' by subjecting such movement to a grid of computational, economic intelligibility.},

In using the work/play/subjectivity connection to locate similarities between video games and the logic of globalist paradigms, the author presents a revised understanding of what constitutes the political dimensions of video games and the experiences they elicit in their players.

He shows how admiration for heroes can help form a civic identity fostering a strong sense of active citizenship. Additionally, he explores the possibility of a less demanding form of citizenship less dependent on heroic models and consequently more compatible with a degree of independence among ordinary people. Comparison of heroic citizenship and the anti-heroic citizenship portrayed in Emile and the unfinished Emile and Sophie shows us how much personal independence must be sacrificed to heroic citizenship, and the limits of efforts to build community spirit on the basis of personal independence. Rousseau acknowledges that the rarity of heroic or anti-heroic strength of soul tempts us to seek less rigorous models of citizenship, but warns of the price to be paid even in these models.},

By providing conceptual discussions of myth, discourse, and ideology, Kelsey proposes a discourse-mythological framework designed for analysing discursive constructions of mythology. In doing so, this research considers multiple recontextualisations of the blitz myth when popular memories of 1940 recurred in 2005. Kelsey encourages readers to understand the politics of remembering by showing how popular yet inaccurate stories from the past have a significant impact on our perceptions of the present. Heroism, trauma, economics, royalty, rituals, human rights, foreign policy, immigration and multiculturalism are just some of the topics covered across a vast landscape of stories embracing a myth from the past in order to understand the present."--},

The manosphere celebrates a toxic hegemonic masculinity that encourages sexual violence and portrays violence as an understandable response to a feminized culture that denigrates manhood. Evidence has shown that several recent cases of murder, mass murder, and rape involved offenders who participated in this subculture prior to engaging in their crimes. Through the use of quotes gathered directly from the websites and message boards frequented by individuals within the subculture, this book offers an in-depth analysis of the ideology of the manosphere, and the common attitudes, values, and beliefs promoted within the various groups that comprise the subculture. It will also present a theoretical perspective that may shed light on what draws men to these groups and the processes by which they become radicalized to the far right and violent extremism. This book will be of interest to scholars and students in criminology, sociology, and political science, and others interested in examining the manifestation and effects of the manosphere on crime and criminal justice"-- Provided by publisher},

Ultimately, such a distinction is futile when our everyday experiences are so ubiquitously augmented by technologies---even the act of playing Binary Domain by coupling with a virtual character through a videogame controller challenges any clear distinction between human and machine. While such themes are not new to science fiction, the anxieties expressed by Binary Domain's characters are relevant to what have emerged over the past twentyfive years as two formative modes of identifying with videogames: the dominant hacker and the integrated cyborg. The hacker, an identity that the dominant and hegemonic `gamer' consumer identity can trace a clear lineage from, comes to represent the masculinist, mastery-focused identity that most blockbuster games celebrate.The cyborg emerges in resistance to the hacker, pointing to a diversity of forms and identities focused less on mastering the machine than participating with it. This paper uses Binary Domain's complex anxieties towards technology as a lens through which to trace the histories of these constitutive modes of identifying with videogames, and to demonstrate the influence they have on shaping videogame forms and audiences.},

Our bodies engage with videogames in complex and fascinating ways. Through an entanglement of eyes-on-screens, ears-at-speakers, and muscles-against-interfaces, we experience games with our senses. But, as Brendan Keogh argues in A Play of Bodies, this corporal engagement goes both ways; as we touch the videogame, it touches back, augmenting the very senses with which we perceive. Keogh investigates this merging of actual and virtual bodies and worlds, asking how our embodied sense of perception constitutes, and becomes constituted by, the phenomenon of videogame play. In short, how do we perceive videogames? Keogh works toward formulating a phenomenology of videogame experience, focusing on what happens in the embodied engagement between the playing body and the videogame, and anchoring his analysis in an eclectic series of games that range from mainstream to niche titles. Considering smartphone videogames, he proposes a notion of co-attentiveness to understand how players can feel present in a virtual world without forgetting that they are touching a screen in the actual world. He discusses the somatic basis of videogame play, whether games involve vigorous physical movement or quietly sitting on a couch with a controller; the sometimes overlooked visual and audible pleasures of videogame experience; and modes of temporality represented by character death, failure, and repetition. Finally, he considers two metaphorical characters: the ``hacker,'' representing the hegemonic, masculine gamers concerned with control and configuration; and the ``cyborg,'' less concerned with control than with embodiment and incorporation.},

  abstract = {Globalization and technical change have had a significant impact on work in the cultural industries. Online games are services that are networked, operate around the clock and require ongoing player and company input. The industry's content production networks are dispersed internationally, and many of its services are offered transnationally. These new services have generated new forms of work, like community management, which are often outsourced to near-to-market locations. Much of the research on media work is focused on high status creative occupations or the free labour of amateurs. This paper draws upon the findings of a content analysis of job advertisements and face-to-face interviews with community managers to examine the recruitment and work of community managers. Using scholarship on media production, media work and emotional labour this article argues that recruitment and organizational practices surrounding community managers appropriate passion, community, and experience in the service of capital, but also marginalize these workers. While community managers see themselves as creative workers, their visibility and creative autonomy are limited by organizational and workplace cultures.},

Eight in-depth semi-structured interviews were thematically analysed. The findings of the study indicate that visual elements of the game allowed students to develop a conceptual understanding. Although the game fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills, its internal limitations hinder students from confidently applying knowledge in the real world. The study also demonstrates the importance of the instructor's role to retrieve the maximum pedagogic benefits from the game.},

This paper investigates how autonomous agents influence individuals' perceptions and behaviors toward others, particularly human employees. Our research reveals that the socio-emotional capabilities of autonomous agents lead individuals to attribute a humanlike mind to these nonhuman entities. Perceiving a high level of humanlike mind in the nonhuman, autonomous agents affects perceptions of actual people through an assimilation process. Consequently, we observe ``assimilation-induced dehumanization'': the humanness judgment of actual people is assimilated toward the lower humanness judgment of autonomous agents, leading to various forms of mistreatment. We demonstrate that assimilation-induced dehumanization is mitigated when autonomous agents possess capabilities incompatible with humans, leading to a contrast effect (Study 2), and when autonomous agents are perceived as having a high level of cognitive capability only, resulting in a lower level of mind perception of these agents (Study 3). Our findings hold across various types of autonomous agents (embodied: Studies 1--2 and disembodied: Studies 3--5), as well as in real and hypothetical consumer choices.},

This study examines how game narratives are analyzed in a structuralism mythology and make theoretical bases which can explain game narratives, and finds out the meaning of myths in game narratives. Many studies on the relationship between games and myth have been researched. However, these are meaningful in terms of how myths are reflected on narratives as a hero narrative. This article investigated the relationships between game narratives and the theories of Levi-Strauss and Gilbert Durand who are structuralism mythologists. As a result, restructuring and synchronicity on the structuralism mythology can explain game narratives which are different from written language narrative, and myth, a spoken literature, is meaningful in that it restructures the forgotten orality in game narratives.},

Spin-off games based on major film franchises are common, especially in genres such as science fiction, action-adventure and horror. Some games have also made the transition to the big screen, none more prominently than the Tomb Raider series in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). The potential benefits of such tieins are apparent at the industrial level, in a global media economy in which games and cinema often exist in the orbit of the same corporate giants. To what extent, though, is it useful to look at games more closely in the light of cinema? The aim of this paper is to explore points of contact between computer games and aspects of cinema, but also to highlight important differences and distinctions. The main focus is on the formal/textual qualities of games in relation to cinema, although reference is also made to aspects of industrial and broader cultural context. The paper also considers some more general questions raised by the use of paradigms from one media form in relation to another.},

  abstract = {Heroes are ubiquitous in literature and popular discourse, yet little is known about cognitive representations of heroes. We examined lay conceptions of heroes using a prototype approach, compared heroes with other persons of influence, and studied how individuals use hero features to identify heroes. In Study 1, participants (N = 189) generated open-ended descriptions of heroes, which were sorted by independent coders into 26 meaningful categories. In Study 2, participants (N = 365) rated the centrality of these features, and subsequently classified each feature as either central (e.g., brave, moral integrity) or peripheral (e.g., humble, proactive). In a reaction time (RT) paradigm, participants in Study 3 (N = 33) identified central features of heroes faster than peripheral features. In Study 4, participants (N = 25) remembered more central hero features than peripheral features in a surprise recall task. In Study 5 (N = 89), participants most strongly identified a hero when the target was described with central features (vs. peripheral or neutral features). In Studies 6 (N = 212) and 7 (N = 307), participants' ratings evidenced that the prototypical features of heroes did not fit conceptually as well for role models and leaders. In all, these studies contribute new ideas to existing knowledge about heroes, and contribute to a shared understanding of what a hero means to people. Our research is thus an important step in refining heroism into a scientific concept. The notion of the prototypical features of heroes provides a basis for future hero research and intervention.},

Other research points to social motives as one of several motivations for gambling, but more knowledge is needed on social gambling practices. This paper presents empirical data from ethnographic fieldwork in a Danish upper-secondary school collected spring 2023. Specifically, I analyze data from a class where young men play on digital slot machines and sports betting. I understand the young men's group as an affinity space, and through this framework analyze their norms, identities and practices. These connect the men to each other, the rest of the school and a culture beyond the school. Through these analyses, I show an example of a socially constructed gambling space in Danish school. I argue that social motives and a sense of belonging are important motivational factors in these young men's gambling. By showing actual practices, I expand our knowledge on social motivation for gambling. I argue that this knowledge has implications for prevention.},

However, some games with complicated and opaque dynamics are still valued by many. These games are "procedurally hostile," as it is difficult to understand the connection between player action and effect on the game state. In this paper, we explore the experience of playing an intentionally inscrutable game, with no winning strategy. Using a mixed methods approach, we find that while players initially follow a logical and systematic approach, there are a range of responses to the players' failure to understand how their actions affect the game state. Apart from frustration, we find some players embrace the narrative, shifting to enjoying the game as a primarily role-playing experience. This finding is useful to game designers, as it gives insight into the initial response players have to complex game systems and how players make meaning over time.},

Players experience total control over their environment and dominance over the creatures inhabiting it. The appeal of this scenario, I argue, is simulational.

In Narrative Interplay in the Digital Era, leading scholars and artists explore how digital narratives, alternate reality games, and AI-driven storytelling reshape how we create, experience, and teach interactive fiction. This collection moves beyond traditional analysis and examines the social and artistic dimensions of interactivity, highlighting how narratives unfold dynamically through player engagement and machine collaboration. Organized into three sections---alternate realities, digital interactive fiction, and the politics of gaming---this book reveals the evolving role of play and interactivity in contemporary education, creative expression, and online culture. Contributors offer insights from inside the creative process, centering the perspectives of game designers and artists to shed light on how interactive stories emerge at the intersection of technology and human imagination. A practical resource for researchers in game studies, electronic literature, and digital storytelling, this collection also speaks to educators and creators eager to explore how AI and interactivity are redefining the future of narrative.},

Too often educational videogames are narrowly focused on specific learning outcomes dictated by school curricula and fail to engage young learners. This book suggests another approach, offering a guide to designing games that integrates content and play and creates learning experiences that connect to many areas of learners' lives. These games are not gamified workbooks but are embedded in a long-form experience of exploration, discovery, and collaboration that takes into consideration the learning environment. Resonant Games describes twenty essential principles for designing games that offer this kind of deeper learning experience, presenting them in connection with five games or collections of games developed at MIT's educational game research lab, the Education Arcade. Each of the games---which range from Vanished, an alternate reality game for middle schoolers promoting STEM careers, to Ubiquitous Bio, a series of casual mobile games for high school biology students---has a different story, but all spring from these fundamental assumptions: honor the whole learner, as a full human being, not an empty vessel awaiting a fill-up; honor the sociality of learning and play; honor a deep connection between the content and the game; and honor the learning context---most often the public school classroom, but also beyond the classroom.},

The second part provides basic caveats and tries to answer frequently asked questions concerning the possible uses of this guide. The third part lays out ten points of the proposed procedure, which has been designed to inspire interpretative questions and to formulate research hypotheses. The procedure has been grounded in contemporary game studies research perspectives that relate to hermeneutic philosophy. In its essence, this guide offers a non-totalizing list of exploratory insights, designed to simplify the process of preparing a hermeneutic interpretation of a digital game.

This study investigated gender traits and sexual orientation to further explain why people play games and what leads to gaming enjoyment. Methods: Participants (N = 198) answered questions on gender traits (positive/negative feminity/masculinity), gaming motivations, enjoyment, sexual orientation (32.0\% of the sample belonged to the lesbian, gay, and bisexual community, later LGB community), and demographics. Results: Only certain gender traits are linked to specific gaming motivations. Negative masculinity increased competence and relatedness while negative femininity decreased autonomy. Similar results were found for sexual orientation. LGB people showed less competence and intuitive control motivations. Additionally, LGB people spent more time playing video games than non-LGB people. They reported playing puzzles more as well. No other differences were found for game genre selection. Discussion: The lack of differences based on sexual orientation and gender traits shows that video games offer an environment for everybody and thus have the potential to bring people together. \copyright{} The Author(s) 2022.},

We also suggest the following directions of myth research in video games: the study of mythodesign in video games; the analysis of archetypes usage, mythologems, mythological images, symbols and plots in video games; the study of mythological narrative construction features in video games; identification and analysis of mythological ideas shared by gaming communities and subcultures.},

To critically consider how fandom has developed on Discord, we analyze how power structures and intimacies between and across fandoms are constructed across three levels on the platform. At the smallest scale, rules, roles, and fan practices within individual Discord servers afford the explicit hierarchization of fans and the regulation of fan discourses. Next, Discord's subscription services encourage economic and cultural competition across and between servers of the same fan text. Finally, fan practices and discourses stretch across the entire Discord platform, connecting seemingly disparate fandoms through a variety of fan activities. By examining how fan practices and the platform's affordances constitute power structures and intimacies across these three levels, we provide a primer on the affordances and critical sites of inquiry on the ever-expanding Discord platform.},

This article considers the earmarks of storytelling as defined by Benjamin and by contemporary writer Larry McMurtry and argues this type of narrative experience can be offered via interactive media and, in particular, video games. After identifying the key characteristics of storytelling as set forth by Benjamin, the article proposes and advocates for a set of key characteristics of video game storytelling. In doing so, the article argues that effective narrative immersion can offer what Benjamin calls counsel, or wisdom, by refusing to provide pat answers or neat conclusions and suggests these as strategies for game writers and developers who want to provide educational or transformative experiences. Throughout, the article invokes historic and contemporary video games, asking for careful consideration of the ways in which games focused on sometimes highly personal narratives rely on storytelling techniques that instruct and transform and that can provide a rich framework for the design and writing of narrative games.},

However, we see that many interactive digital narratives (IDN) including narrative video games derive their story structures from the same formulas connected to Joseph Campbell and Aristotle, adhering to the trajectory of the Hero's Journey and the dramatic arc. We engage with scholarly criticism exposing the supposed ubiquity of these structures and agree that the question of narrative models in interactive digital media requires both further exploration and intervention. We follow up on some proposed solutions by looking at non-Western narrative traditions to expand the corpus of narrative structures available to game designers and other narrative developers. With this paper we raise awareness of alternative structures and simultaneously introduce implementable narrative structures with the aim to expand the design space and range of analytical models for IDN.},

  abstract = {As Frankenstein's 200th anniversary nears, its use as a shorthand for ethical critique only increases. This article argues, though, that its lessons inhere in its unique structure, which enacts an interpretive process that models the multiplicity and uncertainty constitutive of ethical decision-making. Frankenstein deliberately functions as a modern myth, rewriting classical and Christian mythology to challenge the straightforward moral lessons often ascribed to the text. Complex portrayals of the creature and of Victor Frankenstein in the context of contemporary science make it impossible to read Victor as villain, victim or hero, or to take a consequentialist or nature-based stance in which the outcome of his research dictates its wrongness. The use of Paradise Lost insists on the creature's fundamental humanity. Indeed, the creature's voice frames the entire novel and serves as its structural centrepiece. His experience counters Victor's and vividly expresses the harm in a narrow focus on discovery and in the denial of responsibility for scientific work as it moves beyond the laboratory. Both the creature's and Captain Walton's stories stress the need to hear other voices and honour their distinct lived experiences. While Frankenstein-as-myth (re)produces science as the fundamental explanatory paradigm, it presents a vision of science as passionately personal and societally situated. Repeated disruptions of narrative cohesion question accuracy and causality, producing instead an acute awareness of perspective. Frankenstein argues for a reflective and dialogical narrative ethics: choices must be made and evaluated not according to a priori abstract rules, but within the attached stories.},

In this he seems to be successful, as Socrates is today highly regarded for his description of the good life and for his unwillingness to live any other sort of life, a position that is most obviously exemplified by his defence in the Apology. After his sentencing, Socrates' arguments and actions - in the Crito and the Phaedo - also lend considerable support to the idea that the philosopher is committed to living a particularly good sort of life. While the sequence of dialogues that culminates in Socrates' execution might seem to be the most obviously critical of the life of the philosopher, these dialogues actually serve to enshrine the character of Socrates as the quintessential moral hero.},

In so doing, churches undertake actions defined as strategies intended to both expand and maintain community -- and assert authority. The article draws on the results of qualitative analyses of the media ensembles of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and Orthodox Churches in Poland and the UK, along with interviews with media professionals from these churches. The conclusion is that the media settlers concept expands and develops our grasp of the religious-social shaping of technology [Campbell, Heidi A. 2010. When Religion Meets New Media. London: Routledge] by investigating how religious organizations actively shape their media to attain institutional goals, and in consequence transform their media ensembles.},

I redesigned everything from scratch.Recently, one of the students in my course on the history of city planning (offered in the University Honors Program at the University of Maryland at College Park) ambled up after class. ``Have you ever played sin city?'' I thought I heard him ask. He set me straight---``SimCity'' he said, enunciating carefully---and then offered a demonstration, during which I was reminded of Caro's book.

This essay addresses the question of the essential or phenomenal givenness of selfhood, as proposed in Zhao's (2005) paper, by tracing the conceptual strife in anthropological theories from Marcel Mauss onwards, pointing to the problems associated with abstract categories which become only meaningful as well as observable through concentration on the performativity of the social. To concretize the abstract issue, the essay concentrates on the notion of the mask as it surfaces through ritual and theatrical performances in Japan. As Japanese behavioural codes have also become the mainstay of comparative references for western notions of individuality, the essay presents a case-study of masked ritual performance in order to show the embodiment of abstract notions in ritual play as well as in theatrical staging. Following this case study the essay finishes with questions about the ludic nature of theatrical, ritual as well as social enactments of self in Japanese cultural practices, trying to connect these to the theoretical system of the ludic, as proposed by Roger Caillois (1958).},

  abstract = {In this study, I have chosen "hypertext" as the central concept. If we define hypertext as interconnected bits of language (I am stretching Ted Nelson's original definition quite a lot, but still maintaining its spirit, I believe) we can understand why Nelson sees hypertext "as the most general form of writing". There is no inherent connotation to digital in hypertext (the first hypertext system was based on microfilms), but it is the computerized, digital framework - allowing the easy manipulation of both texts and their connections - which gives the most out of it. In addition to the "simple" hypertexts, there is a whole range of digital texts much more complex and more "clever", which cannot be reduced to hypertext, even though they too are based on hypertextuality. Such digital texts as MUDs (Multi User Domains - text based virtual realities) are clearly hypertextual - there are pieces of text describing different environments usually called "rooms" and the user may wander from room to room as in any hypertext. At the same time, however, there are several other functions available for the user, she may talk with other users, write her own rooms, program objects performing special tasks, or, solve problems and collect game points.  Hypertextuality and hypertext theory do not help us much (if at all) in understanding this kind of textual functionality. For that we need cybertext theory. Cybertextuality is - as Espen Aarseth has defined it - a perspective on all texts, a perspective which takes into account and foregrounds the functionality of all texts. From the cybertextual point of view all texts are machines which perform certain functions and which have to be used in a certain way. Also, the reader may be required to perform some functions in order to be able to read the texts, or, she may be allowed to act as an active participant inside the textual world. Cybertextuality, then, is not only about digital texts, but because digital form allows much more freedom to textual functionality, there is much more need for cybertext theory in the field of digital texts than in print text. (1) So, keeping in mind cybertextuality is a perspective on all texts, we can use the term cybertext in a more limited sense to refer to functional digital texts - this means that all digital texts are not necessary cybertexts (plain text files like in the Project Gutenberg archives, or, e-texts in pdf format are no more functional than average print texts). Now we can better define the scope of this study. The theoretical framework is a combination of cybertext theory and more traditional theory of literature. The focus is on hypertext fiction, even though several other text types - digital and non-digital, literary and non literary, fiction and poetry - are also discussed. To deepen the understanding of hypertext fiction and its reading, quite of lot of attention is paid to the evolutionary line of print fiction which seems to be a major influence in the background. That aspect explains the first part of the subtitle, "From text to hypertext", with an emphasis on the transitory phase we are witnessing. On the other hand, the approach is open to the latent aspects of the hypertexts discussed, which already refer to the wider cybertextual properties - because of that the "and Beyond". In the main title, "Digital Literature", literature is used in a narrow ("literary") sense. The method is inductive in that through scrutinizing individual, concrete exmples, a more general understanding of the field is sought after. Through not trying to include all the possible digital text types in this study I aim to be more analytic than descriptive. This work should be seen as a collection of independent papers - some of them are previously published, some are still waiting for a proper forum. Most of them have started as seminar papers. I have used the opportunity to make some corrections and changes to the articles previously published (mainly to reduce redundancy, or, to add materials cut out from the publications) - thus, the chapters of this study are not identical with published versions. In the first chapter of this study I will give a description of the various traditions behind digital literature, of characteristic properties of digital literature, and, the basics of cybertext theory. I consider various hypertext studies belonging as a part to the broader category of cybertext theory. The second chapter, "Hyperhistory, Cybertheory: From Memex to ergodic literature", is an overview of cybertext theory, circling around Aarseth's theory of cybertext and ergodic literature. Various other approaches are discussed, and integrated to the theoretical framework. For understanding cybertext theory, a historical glance to the development of hypertext systems (and ideologies behind them) is necessary. The integration of hyper- and cybertheories is still very much in progress - hopefully this chapter contributes to that integration. In the third chapter "Replacement and Displacement. At the limits of print fiction", several novels and stories are scrutinized from the cybertextual perspective. The aim of the chapter is to show the various ways in which print fiction has anticipated hypertextual practices. The fourth chapter, "Ontolepsis: from violation to central device" focusses on the narrative device which I have dubbed ontolepsis. Ontolepsis covers different kinds of "leaks" between separate ontological levels (inside fictional universe). Metalepsis, the crossing of levels of embedded narration, is one type of ontolepses, and certainly so far the most studied one. There is a rather lengthy discussion of fictional ontology, and its relation to narrative levels, because these are essential topics in understanding the phenomenon of ontolepsis in all its forms. A science fiction novel, Philip K. Dick's Ubik, is used as an example, because its multilayered ontology serves perfectly in illustrating the multifarious nature of ontolepsis. In fiction, ontolepses have been seen as violations of certain conventions - the latter part of the chapter discusses how in hypertext fiction ontolepsis has become a central narrative device. In the fifth chapter, "Visual structuring of hypertext narratives", three hypertexts, Michael Joyce's Afternoon, Stuart Moulthrop's Victory Garden, and Shelley Jackson's Patchwork Girl, are analyzed stressing their navigation interfaces and use of "spatial signification". Narratological questions are also foregrounded. Chapters six and seven, "Reading Victory Garden - Competing Interpretations and Loose Ends" and "In Search of Califia" form a pair. They are rather lengthy analyses, or, interpretations, of Stuart Moulthrop's Victory Garden, and M. D. Coverley's Califia. In the end of Califia chapter, the question of interpreting hypertexts is discussed. Two forms of interpretative practice, hermeneutics and poetics, seem to have their own roles in regard to hypertexts. The next chapter, "Negotiating new reading conventions" focusses on reading. In this chapter I'll look at how traditional reading conventions, on the one hand, still inform hypertext reading, and on the other hand, how hypertexts themselves teach new reading habits, and how new reading formations are negotiated. The final chapter, "Hypertext Fiction in the Twilight Zone" is a kind of summary. It suggest that fiction based on "pure" hypertext may be closing its end, and at the same time, looks at the cybertextual means which have appeared to fertilize the field anew. In the horizon there are computer games, virtual realities and other massively programmed forms towering, but also a possibility for a new literature.},

What can World War Two strategy games teach us about the reality of this complex and multifaceted period? Do the possibilities of playing with the past change the way we understand history? If we embody a colonialist's perspective to conquer 'primitive' tribes in Colonization, does this privilege a distinct way of viewing history as benevolent intervention over imperialist expansion? The fusion of these two fields allows the editors to pose new questions about the ways in which gamers interact with their game worlds. Drawing these threads together, the collection concludes by asking whether digital games - which represent history or historical change - alter the way we, today, understand history itself"--},

However, much of our knowledge about these `revolutions' arises from media sensationalism and advertising clamor -- from AI hype. Therefore, to understand the societal impacts of AI, we must first grapple with its hype and ask: What truly transpires in the `revolutions' allegedly brought about by AI? What role does hype play in them? This paper addresses this need by offering a methodological framework for studying AI, a way to scrutinize AI hype while acknowledging its power. I begin by presenting the STATE typology of AI hype that differentiates between five distinct types of hype. I then offer six heuristics to identify and explore AI hype. Lastly, I argue that holistic empirical research can leverage the STATE typology and its heuristics into a robust methodological design for scrutinizing AI-driven phenomena and their hype.},

The book explores key developments such as virtual and augmented reality, the use of micro-transactions, the integration of loot boxes, and the growth of mobile gaming and games for change (serious games).

  abstract = {The Canadian developer BioWare's much applauded inclusion of same-sex romance options in mass-market games has rightfully been received as a crucial step towards greater inclusivity and recognition of LGBTQ* identifying audiences. However, the terms of inclusion/ exclusion warrant careful critical attention. Who is represented and how? Who has voice and agency and who is marginalised or silenced? These questions are as crucial to videogames as they are to novels or films. This article discusses the ludic and narrative presentation of non-hegemonic masculinities in BioWare's Mass Effect trilogy from a queer game studies perspective (Ruberg \& Shaw 2017). Drawing on a framework proposed by Schr\"oter \& Thon (2014), characters are analysed as fictional being, game pieces and, in the case of the playable character, representations of the player. Taking into account these multiple dimensions of character presentation and paying close attention to the intersections of sexuality, gender, race and (dis)ability helps unravel the complex and shifting meanings at the heart of the game's sexual politics. At first glance, Mass Effect's military setting and several gameplay aspects reminiscent of the first-person shooter seem to uphold a heteropatriarchal system foregrounding the hegemonic male as normative ideal. However, the prominent position of queer masculinities increasingly disturbs this reading and challenges the dominance of the white, heterosexual, attractive, male videogame protagonist. In this sense, Mass Effect serves as an example of how mass-market videogames can reclaim cultural space for marginalised subject positions.},

However, though mods are roughly all equally (il)legal, the industry only sometimes uses its legal power to stop them. In this article, we explore the economic and social factors that impact how video game corporations employ the law in relation to modding, revealing a symbiotic relationship. We argue that the specific content of a mod matters for how it's assessed and whether rightsholders attempt to stop it. We propose a new model where structural analysis of the modder--industry relationship is supplemented with textual analysis that asks of specific mods who they benefit and harm. We argue that this will enable a better understanding of when and how the industry takes legal action.},

  abstract = {This essay examines the role of myth in and as cultural memory through a reading of the novel, Archipelago (2013), by the Trinidadian-British author Monique Roffey. Against conceptions of the Anthropocene as a break from the past---a break that repeats the myth of modernity---I argue that Roffey's use of cultural memory offers a carnivalesque relation to the world in response to the narrative's account of climate change trauma. Drawing on Bakhtin's classic study of the carnival as an occasion for contestation and renewal, as well as Cheryl Lousely's call for a ``carnivalesque ecocriticism,'' this essay expands on the recent ecocritical turn to the field of Memory Studies (Buell; Goodbody; Kennedy) to illustrate the way literature mediates between mythic and historical relations to the natural world. As literary expressions, the carnivalesque and the grotesque evoke myth and play in order to expose and transform the social myths which govern relations and administrate difference. Since literature acts as both a producer and reflector of cultural memory, this essay seeks to highlight the literary potential of myth for connecting past traumas to affirmational modes of political engagement.},

  abstract = {This article explores the strategies of queer playing of video games and their relationship to the heteronormative game culture. Its premise is that most video games are, either implicitly or explicitly, heteronormative and the inscribed player of such games is in the majority of cases a heterosexual male. In order to achieve the same level of identification with an avatar and to enjoy a similar gameplay experience as the heterosexual player, the LGBT player may have to deploy various strategies to challenge the game and work around it, or to find the LGBT content which some more progressive games offer. The study is based on in-depth qualitative interviews with six players (5 males and 1 female) who identified themselves both as homosexual and as players of the Mass Effect or Dragon Age series, games that include several opportunities to initiate same-sex romance. We have identified three different queer playing strategies: imaginative play (queer reading of unspecified or heterosexual characters), stylized performance (the use of gay stereotypes to mark one as queer) and role-playing of a LGBT character. However, players do not seek sexuality in games to the same extent as they do in film or TV, and they tend to use these strategies, and especially the latter two, reluctantly or with reservations. These reservations may be linked to our finding that LGBT players consider their gay (or lesbian) identities disconnected from their identities as players or gamers. This can be explained by the mutual exclusivity of gay communities and the heteronormative game culture.},

This article argues that to understand the game's formal, aesthetic, and structural specificity, its pleasures and potential meanings, it is essential to investigate how the mythic functions. The author shows that the mythic plays a primary role in making a consistent fantasy world in terms of game play, morality, culture, time, and environment. It provides a rationale for players' actions, as well as the logic that under- pins the stylistic profile of the game, its objects, tasks, and characters. In terms of the ``cultural'' environments of the game, the presence of a coherent and extensive myth scheme is core to the way differences and conflicts between races are organized. And, as a form of intertextual resonance, its mythology furnishes the game with a ``thickness'' of meaning that promotes, for players, a sense of mythological being as well as encouraging an in-depth textual engagement.},

Why have they proved to be one of the most versatile and popular monster types in the growing video game industry? What makes zombies such widespread symbols of horror and dread, and how have portrayals of zombies in movies changed and evolved to fit contemporary fears, anxieties, and social issues? Zombies have held a unique place in film and popular culture throughout most of the 20th century. Rare in that this enduring monster type originated in non-European folk culture rather than the Gothic tradition from which monsters like vampires and werewolves have emerged, zombies have in many ways superseded these Gothic monsters in popular entertainment and the public imagination and have increasingly been used in discussions ranging from the philosophy of mind to computer lingo to the business press. Zombie Culture brings together scholars from a variety of fields, including cinema studies, popular culture, and video game studies, who have examined the living dead through a variety of lenses. By looking at how portrayals of zombies have evolved from their folkloric roots and entered popular culture, readers will gain deeper insights into what zombies mean in terms of the public psyche, how they represent societal fears, and how their evolving portrayals continue to reflect underlying beliefs of The Other, contagion, and death.},

Drawing on ethnographic research focused on the contents of Austrian children's rooms, this paper explores traceable manifestations of history and historical fiction, particularly toy dragons and dinosaurs, in their properties as objects and as focuses of their owners' interpretations as ascertained in interviews. The research finds little clear demarcation in the minds of the children interviewed (all between 8 and 12 years old) between imaginings and cognitive attempts to reconstruct the past.

Beginning in Vancouver and ending in London, England, Mass Effect 3 immerses players in world-ending conflicts linked with historical Canadian wartime experiences, which are creatively disguised through inventive science fiction. This game evokes ideas of colonial duty and personal self-sacrifice; players also confront cultural eugenics similar to social Darwinism during World War II. Canadian and queer identities develop in tandem as players consider humanitarian and inclusive possibilities, performing with outer space races in conflict. Players can even personalize their own Commander Shepard by customizing his/her gender, race, and sexuality. During the game, players may pursue intimate relationships with other men, women, or alien non-player characters; these choices are developed as moments of ``coming out'' that parallel the Canadian content revelations in the game. All of these contemporary identity negotiations create a vastly complex system of video game user-generated performances as players help their Canadian Commander Shepard reshape the universe.},

  abstract = {The history of Finnish games is diverse. It consists not only of commercially successful digital games or board game classics that have knit together generations. Finnish game history is multifaceted both in terms of technologies and execution, as well as content and impact. The reception of games varies: some are highly praised, others become dearly loved, some are deplored and many will simply become forgotten. A game is a versatile format for a variety of works, by different creators and for different types of players.Games are valuable fixtures of cultural histories around the globe. Finnish games are in a precious role in the cultural heritage of Finland. This book offers only a small sample of games. The idea for the book was conceived during an exhibition organised in a local museum during the Nordic DiGRA 2012 conference, Tampere Finland. Four researchers and roughly 20 students joined efforts to build an exhibition to introduce foreign visitors to local games. Game developers, journalists, historians and collectors lent a helping hand in putting everything together. The multiform exhibition reflected the different backgrounds of the members of the team -- we ended up opening a diverse view towards Finnish games. Although the exhibition was open only for a short time, the success surpassed all expectations. The work conducted for  the exhibition has been updated for this book, and it has served as a basis for the Finnish Museum of Games opened in 2016. Game history is common knowledge, but not always easy to access. It is time to put more effort in recording the history for future generations as well as to trace the paths already forgotten. Games cannot, however, be understood simply by reading -- they must be experienced. Hopefully this book will show a guiding light towards understanding games in a wider spectrum and bring everyone closer to the actual experiences.},

  abstract = {The World is Born From Zero is an investigation into the relationship between video games and science fiction through the philosophy of speculation. Cameron Kunzelman argues that the video game medium is centered on the evaluation and production of possible futures by following video game studies, media philosophy, and science fiction studies to their furthest reaches. Claiming that the best way to understand games is through rigorous formal analysis of their aesthetic strategies and the cultural context those strategies emerge from, Kunzelman investigates a diverse array of games like The Last of Us, VA-11 Hall-A, and Civilization VI in order to explore what science fiction video games can tell us about their genres, their ways of speculating, and how the medium of the video game does (or does not) direct us down experiential pathways that are both oppressive and liberatory. Taking a multidisciplinary look at these games, The World is Born From Zero offers a unique theorization of science fiction games that provides both science fiction studies and video game studies with new tools for thinking how this medium and mode inform each other.},

That pressure emanates in part from the fast-paced policy world studied by the researcher, and in part (perhaps even more significantly) from the university environment of the researcher herself. The essay highlights how the tendency towards output-driven or fast research operates and what analytical traps it engenders. My goal is to spell out, more explicitly than is commonly done, why the push toward fast research is problematic on analytical grounds and why it ought to be resisted on these same grounds. I call for slow research to underscore that context-sensitive critical investigation of a social field, such as policy, is a necessarily slow process.},

  abstract = {This thesis is an examination of narrative structure of single-player story-driven video games, shifting the focus toward the exploration of their design and methods by which game designers and authors are able to use the language of interactivity in order to convey meaning to a video game player. Although the role of the player is important in examining video game narratives, it is only recently that scholars and critics have begun to examine the role that the game designer has in creating the conditions that allow for meaning to be created in the first place. This thesis examines the narrative structure of video games by exploring the major attempts to define a language of video games and using this criticism to suggest a greater shift toward considering how many moments of interactivity are purposefully designed in order to encourage a specific interpretation of the game's narrative. The thesis surveys a significant number of video games to help illustrate how player interactivity is specifically authored and uses this survey to provide context for a more in depth discussion of major single-player story-driven video games released in the last few years. This thesis concludes that a new framework for studying narratives in video games and authoring video game narratives is needed, suggesting that moments of carefully controlled interactivity are the building blocks of the language of video games.},

Typical analysis involves the use of human studies, rating the quality of the generated narratives against a given set of criteria, a costly and time consuming process. In this paper we integrate a set of features within the ReGEN system which aim to ensure narrative correctness and quality. Correct generation is ensured by performing an analysis of the preconditions and postconditions of each narrative event. Narrative quality is ensured by using an existing set of formal metrics which relate quality to the structure of the narrative to guide narrative generation.  This quantitative approach provides an objective means of guaranteeing quality within narrative generation.},

In this conceptual work, we go through the current eight generations of Pok\'emon games, movies and anime episodes to understand why the franchise appeals to humans. We focus on the following four core themes: (1) relationship with the Pok\'emon creatures; (2) exploration and adventure; (3) social connectedness and acceptance; and (4) green technologies and living in symbiosis with the environment. We discuss how these themes resonate with human primal desires and what aspects of Pok\'emon transcend into the real world. Our findings indicate that the Pok\'emon world is able to offer humans aspects of the hunter-gatherer era that are missing from the current urban way of living. The franchise appeals to human primal desires by being about exploring the world, understanding it and finding harmony with other living creatures. Our findings support previous work on the appeal of specific Pok\'emon games, and contributes to our understanding of what has made the franchise popular.},

It places in geographic and temporal context various societies represented in Runescape by historicizing in-game cultural representations. Thereafter, it is asserted that players partake in virtual iterations of colonialism to advance their accounts. Analysis is grounded in four case studies exploring the themes of exploitative archaeology, colonial cartography, imperial diplomacy, and resource extraction. Each example represents opportunities for in-game progress. In connecting the virtual advancement of user accounts to performances of colonialism, it is argued that Runescape reproduces historic colonial projects in which European powers commodified other societies to advance their own economic and cultural agendas. Through this analysis, the article seeks to develop a guiding framework for the study of MMORPGs as replicating Eurocentric colonial encounters.},

Ideologically, the novel seems to construct a closed system of a Daoist allegory, which renders a historical Buddhist monk's pilgrimage to fetch the holy scriptures from India into an imaginative journey across the inner landscape in pursuit of immortality -- a landscape that is at once inside the body and cosmological. The closed system starts to crack once we see that the mapping of this micro- and macro-cosmos is never coherent and consistent within the story itself and throughout the history of its interpretations. The otherwise self-contained Chinese religious allegory thus opens up to the world of historical contingency.},

Transmedia is one concept that captures these processes of exchange. This entry discusses the development of transmediality and related concepts in the field of game studies, such as transmedia storytelling, transmedia worlds and transmedia characters. As a theoretical lens, transmedia sheds light on the interdisciplinary nature of play which draws from different texts, aesthetics and fields. Additionally, transmedia is a design practice by creatives and fans alike. Designers increasingly combine different online and offline media in their games, allowing for hybrid forms of play. Transmedia can be a community-driven practice as well. For instance, players frequently create their own transmedia works, such as cosplays, streams or mods, inspired by the games that they love. This entry addresses transmedia both as an analytical tool and as an empirical practice, instigated by designers and audiences. While transmedia processes are very visible today, the concept itself also comes with challenges. In a time when different media converge on online platforms, it is hard to say where a game begins or ends. Transmedia scholarship on games is therefore needed, but always in conjunction with other fields.},

While there has been substantial research to address this question, findings have been contradictory and inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review to compare studies of citations to OA and non-OA articles.                                         Methods               A systematic search of 17 databases attempted to capture all relevant studies authored since 2001. The protocol was registered in Open Science Framework. We included studies with a direct comparison between OA and non-OA items and reported article-level citation as an outcome. Both randomized and non-randomized studies were included. No limitations were placed on study design, language, or publication type.                                         Results               A total of 5,744 items were retrieved. Ultimately, 134 items were identified for inclusion. 64 studies (47.8\%) confirmed the existence of OACA, while 37 (27.6\%) found that it did not exist, 32 (23.9\%) found OACA only in subsets of their sample, and 1 study (0.8\%) was inconclusive. Studies with a focus on multiple disciplines were significantly positively associated with finding that OACA exists in subsets, and are less associated with finding that OACA did not exist. In the critical appraisal of the included studies, 3 were found to have an overall low risk of bias. Of these, one found that an OACA existed, one found that it did not, and one found that an OACA occurred in subsets.                                         Conclusions               As seen through the large number of studies identified for this review, OACA is a topic of continuing interest. Quality and heterogeneity of the component studies pose challenges for generalization. The results suggest the need for reporting guidelines for bibliometrics studies.},

These games serve a fractured form of storytelling, which leaves it to the community to determine what counts as part of the story; or what is considered ``canon''. What is canon is a question of who and what the story is allowed to be about, and what is allowed to be in it. Therefore, it is important to understand how players of perennial games understand what is canon and what is not.   This paper presents a mixed methods study of an online survey (N=118) and interviews (N=15) of players of the game Destiny 2, with the goal of understanding what events players consider canon and why.   The findings indicate that while authorship and conventional game story elements are considered canon, there is still disagreement, especially as the storytelling methods become non-conventional. Players can provide nuanced viewpoints on why an event is or is not canon, and they do not always agree. These results can help designers understand how their decisions influence the community discussions of canonicity, and how properties of their game can help create experiences that lets players see themselves in the work.},

  abstract = {Perennial games---ongoing, live games---are a form of games that often seem at odds with storytelling through their temporality, repetition and strange diegesis. This paper proposes a reframing of storytelling in perennial games as myth to alleviate these problems. Two layers of myth are presented, the first as the constructed fictional layer, and the second as the lived experience of the communities and people engaging with the game. This avoids the traditional player/author split, often seen as problematic in perennial games, by not focusing on authorship or control of these layers. Rather, it focuses on what each layer is affecting about the experience, how both authors and audience can engage with each layer, and how these layers affect each other. Three additional problems with perennial storytelling are identified that this reframing as myth helps alleviate. Framing the play of perennial games as myth shows how players are a part of a greater mythological experience in a disenchanted world. It explains the repetitive nature of perennial games as re-enactment and ritual, instead of as a logic-breaking repetition of story events. Furthermore, mythology has an inherently complicated relationship with truth and fiction, and this fits naturally with a similar relationship of perennial games and diegesis. Through this recontextualisation, we can improve understanding of how players are experiencing and engaging with perennial stories with a holistical understanding of their play and development.},

His insight is that all of us, at one time or another, are engaged in creating personal mythologies that reflect the larger myths of the culture and our own deepest desires and aspirations. This book is a guide for bringing the deeper mythic structures of experience into awareness, for learning to recognize the archetypal content embedded in our dreams and daydreams, feelings, beliefs, relationships, conscious creations, and behavior.},

In this article, I investigate how both Ukrainian and non-Ukrainian online content creators have been making content related to Ruthenia and Ukraine as a response to Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. I highlight how this content allows creators and viewers to voice their opinions on the war, build a sense of solidarity with the Ukrainian military, debate issues related to the war, and raise money for Ukrainians in need. Through close readings of this content, I offer an analysis of how this community uses the game to build a "vernacular geopolitics" in which information about and understandings of international relations and conflicts develop in non-elite settings.},

Arnstein depicted the failings of typical participation processes at the time and characterized aspirations toward engagement that have now been elevated to core values in planning practice. But since that time, the political, economic, and social context has evolved greatly, and planners, organizers, and residents have been involved in planning and community development practice in ways previously unforeseen. Learning from Arnstein's Ladder draws on contemporary theory, expertise, empirical analysis, and practical applications in what is now more commonly termed public engagement in planning to examine the enduring impacts of Arnstein's work and the pervasive challenges that planners face in advancing meaningful public engagement. This book presents research from throughout the world, including Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Portugal, Serbia, and the United States, among others, that utilizes, critiques, revises, and expands upon Arnstein's aspirational vision. It is essential reading for educators and students of planning.},

Correspondingly, for a number of existing schools of inquiry, they raise absorbing questions about game theory, storytelling, space, humancomputer interaction, and the moving image. In the space of this chapter, our ambitions are necessarily modest; we wish to concentrate on only one of the devices that arises out of the trading between cinema, television, and gameplay that is nevertheless at the heart of the video-ness of video games: the camera. How we play video games is dependent on and generated by the uses of the camera: a game-camera is modelled upon the optical set-ups of mechanical and digital cameras and yet, as we shall see, is distinct from them. For instance, the game-camera is an invisible point without virtual representation. Game-cameras are central to playing 3D video games because they present a mediated view into, and a perspective upon, the ``visibility arrangements'' of the game (Watson, 1997). They are at the core of analysing, at any moment, what has just happened, what is currently happening in the game, and what might happen next. The interplay between using the game-camera and the visibility arrangements of the game produce not just the experience of 3D spaces but the very play of the game.},

McKenzie Wark extendsa theory relationship between play and resistance tocontemporary global capitalism in Gamer Theory, a critical theory of games that rests on the gamerstandpoint. Gamers are most capable of bearing witness to the injustices of the social realm incontrast to the ``fair'' structures of game worlds. However, video games as formal rule structures are embedded with ideological forces, products themselves of capitalist enterprise, and video game simulationsare powerful normative or normalizing processes. Inthis paper, I grapple with this uneasy relationship between gamers' resistant play and the normalizing games in which that play occurs. By drawing attentionto the intersections of global capitalism, sexuality,and gender, I employ my own experiences with Persona 4 as a case study in which a game deploys normalizingpower through its mechanics. In turn, I echo apolitical commitment to resistant play and look atgaymers' modding practices as a current site ofresistance, oriented to the construction of spacesthat permit play against normalizing sexual andgender structures. I argue that Gamer Theory's gamer standpoint indeed holds important political salience,but an intersectional approach -- in this case practiced through directed attention to ``gaymers'' -- extends resistance to include both ``free'' play and,importantly, the construction of spaces in which that play occurs.},

The dodo was first described by Dutch sailors landing on Mauritius in 1598, and became extinct in the 1680s or 1690s. Despite this brief period of encounter, the bird was a popular subject in natural-history works and a range of other genres. The dodo will be used here as a counterexample to the historical narratives of taxonomic crisis and abrupt shifts in natural history caused by exotic creatures coming to Europe. Though this bird had a bizarre form, early modern naturalists integrated the dodo and other flightless birds through several levels of conceptual categorization, including the geographical, morphological and symbolic. Naturalists such as Charles L'Ecluse produced a set of typical descriptive tropes that helped make up the European dodo. These long-lived images were used for a variety of symbolic purposes, demonstrated by the depiction of the Dutch East India enterprise in Willem Piso's 1658 publication. The case of the dodo shows that, far from there being a dramatic shift away from emblematics in the seventeenth century, the implicit symbolic roles attributed to exotic beasts by naturalists constructing them from scant information and specimens remained integral to natural history.},

Over nine class sessions students played the game in support of other activities related to several predetermined and emergent topics in U. S. history. Gameplay was whole-class oriented and involved students taking turns at the computer controlling actions in the game. Qualitative methods were used to analyze data that included observation, student work, interviews with students and the teacher, and a journal maintained by the teacher. Findings are presented in four areas, suggesting that Civilization III gameplay is complex and requires creative thinking about how to use game within the constraints of standard U. S. history curricula. Given the findings of this study, we suggest that teachers can make effective use of Civilization III in U. S. history classes when care is taken by the teacher to situate students' game experiences in rich classroom discussions and specific non-game oriented activities. (Contains 2 tables.)},

Myths are our cultural dreams, and sex is pervasive in all mythologies because it has obsessed and confused us like nothing else - what's more, sexual myths, like all myths, can serve many purposes. The reproductive acts of the ancient Greek goddess Gaia perhaps reflect a pre-Olympian matriarchal social system. The tales of the unbridled sexual deeds of the Polynesian Maui, and many others, speak to a natural fascination with the power and mystery of sexual drives. Leeming demonstrates how even when such myths are meant to elicit laughter or titillation, the participation in them of sacred heroes and deities means they are in some sense religious - partial answers to the nature of existence in general, and human sexuality in particular."--Publisher's description.},

He seeks, in other words, to bridge the gap between the realms of theory and practice, between the mental and the social, and between philosophy and reality. In doing so, he ranges through art, literature, architecture and economics, and further provides a powerful antidote to the sterile and obfuscatory methods and theories characteristic of much recent continental philosophy},

I outline the five basic hypotheses of Farca's Emancipated Player (2016) as a dialectic meaning-production between player and implied player and connect it to Zapf's notions about, literature as a cultural ecology and his triadic model of regenerative discourses. Addressing similarities in function and differences in the mediality of literature and videogames and considering recent studies in game-theory and ecocriticsm, I will demonstrate that emancipated play of aesthetically complex videogames can be considered a condition for videogames to work as a form of cultural ecology and thus also serve the function of regenerative force in a cultural context. The following analyses consider especially the use of unnatural anti-conventions as a self-reflexive technique for reflection about videogames themselves, but also trigger reflections about the empirical reality. The games offer perspectives creating blanks for the player to be filled with her imagination and consequently unfold arguments about the aesthetic condition and conventions of videogames as a mirror of an especially capitalist society without regard for the environment or the non-human. It becomes clear, that representation or procedural rhetoric alone cannot be sufficient to describe the aesthetic effect of the videogame as a Gesamtkunstwerk. They can only function as cultural ecology, if we consider them as multimedia artworks offering a degree of openness for the imaginative power of the player. To play videogames is not either to observe or to inhabit, it is the amalgamation of both which enables their creative force to influence the discourse as cultural ecology.},

  abstract = {The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a game preoccupied with grief, atonement and confronting death. The apocalyptic, cyclical framework of the narrative allows players to interact with characters who fear their own deaths. The medieval memento mori tradition is an aesthetic and (sometimes) narrative trope by which medieval writers, artists and songwriters came to terms with their own mortality often through a confrontation with a corpse. The memento mori provided medieval people with their own method of engaging with death through art as well as creating a schemata for avoiding horror in the final moments. Majora's Mask is an absorbing case study for understanding the persistence of the medieval memento mori into the video game medium. Healing and playing become intertwined in Majora's Mask as an interactive memento mori for players to come to terms with their own mortality through their interactions with the game's narrative and characters. Fans have long noted that Majora's Mask is decidedly darker than the other entries in the Zelda series, containing outright surreal plot elements. Majora's Mask addresses childhood's end, grief, loss and the often unsatisfying imperfections of everyday life. Majora's Mask, as a 21st century artefact, hybridizes both the cultural work of the memento mori and the parallel tradition of Japanese Noh theatre through providing a safe environment to explore a confusing world of loss and melancholy.},

This amounts to a critical examination of the paradigmatic approach of interpreting computer games as games accessible for analysis and critique through 'research-play'. Comparing the role of rules in the activity facilitated by `playable artifacts' like single-player computer games or pinball machines to rules in traditional, or more accurately ``transmedial'' (Juul 2003) games, the essay questions the feasibility of considering computer games `games' and suggests that a defining characteristic of `playable artifacts' is to be found from the relationship between materiality and process. Situating playable artifacts in the context of post-phenomenological philosophy of technology, the essay differentiates between attitudes of player, designer, and a scholar. The essay argues that analysis of playable artifacts as `games' is reductive and can be justified only from the perspectives of a player and a game design researcher. Based on analysis of how playable artifacts become meaningful through material resistance, the essay reconfirms the feasibility of the methodological programme of `research-play' while calling for its re-contextualization in relation to authentic interpretation and empathy.},

Making use of Heidegger's duality of ontic and ontological dimensions, and, looking at Cities: Skylines (2015) as an example, this paper reconciles single-player computer games' `gameness' and material-technological form in order to describe the conditions underlying their nterpretation.},

  abstract = {This study addresses socio-political and professional factors driving the surge of the Brazilian fact-checking venture in the last years. Drawing on a set of 16 semi-structured interviews with fact-checkers from 13 active initiatives, it delves into motivations that led journalists to put in motion their fact-checking firms. Based on the existing literature on structural dynamics and professional incentives for fact-checking, the paper suggests that these two instances concur with the advancement of that journalistic subgenre. Research findings show that the last two electoral cycles (2014--2018) created a thriving landscape for fact-checking due to growing political turmoil in Brazil. Besides, there is also an isomorphic tendency in the development of new fact-checking initiatives. Pioneer American and Argentinean fact-checking firms inspired first projects. Nevertheless, motivations for fact-checking have been increasingly diverse over the years, including training workshops, successful coalitions, and grants from foreign investors. This study contributes to the growing scholarship on an emerging journalistic subfield showing the context-sensitive nature of the expansion of the fact-checking enterprise in a milieu distinct from the US-European landscape. Furthermore, it stresses how structural and professional factors act as field-configuring instances of new journalistic ventures.},

The semiotic point of view differentiates between several interrelated levels in analysing conspiracy theories. Mark Fenster also points out that a conspiracy theorist sees even trivial everyday events as signs of manipulation by conspiring forces. The model of mythological semiosis makes it possible to analyse how conspiracy theoretical meaning-making mixes together ideologies from disparate political movements, ideologies that are often contradictory. Les Back has developed the concept of `liquid ideologies' in order to explain how extreme right-wing movements tend to use generally accepted discourses for the purpose of legitimising their own ethno-centric media practices. In addition to mapping the invariant characteristics of conspiracy theories, semiotics provides us with multi-faceted tools to analyse how the representations of conspiracies are constructed.},

These fears and tensions reflect an evermore-interconnected global environment where increased mobility of people, technologies, and disease have produced great social, political, and economical uncertainty. The essays in this collection examine how monstrosity has been used to manage these rising fears and tensions. Analyzing popular films and televisions shows, such as True Blood, Twilight, Paranormal Activity, District 9, Battlestar Galactica, and Avatar, it argues that monstrous narratives of the past decade have become omnipresent specifically because they represent collective social anxieties over resisting and embracing change in the 21st century. The first comprehensive text that uses monstrosity not just as a metaphor for change, but rather a necessary condition through which change is lived and experienced in the 21st century, this approach introduces a different perspective toward the study of monstrosity in culture"--},

Many of these comments gave the impression that if only their authors had been there on the stage they would have set either Peterson or \v Zi\v zek straight. Those who were there had come to see what \v Zi\v zek and Peterson could create together with the conceptual tools each had at his disposal. Some of the audience may have come to witness a ``bloodbath,'' others to see if the two speakers could sharpen their own perspectives on the concept of happiness and on a system better suited to ``making people happy.'' Whatever the expectations and however they were addressed, the follow-up commentaries show that people hold strong views on both the subject of human happiness and how to get there. But there is a more important underlying question: What is the point of holding any discussion when an agreement seems unlikely, including on things as fundamental to human existence as happiness? Why, then, did these two prominent intellectuals engage in a widely publicised discussion at all, and why did \v Zi\v zek refer to it in his introductory lines as the ``duel of the century''? Was it merely a kind of dazzling ``edutainment'' or did he see it as something more substantial?},

The popularity of the debate between Slavoj \v Zi\v zek and Jordan Peterson is reflective of a new yet largely invisible preoccupation by the public at large with intellectual matters engendered by the widespread availability of information technology. Yet, the debate was met with no interest from the field of education, despite the massive interest from the general public. Is there truly nothing that Slavoj \v Zi\v zek or Jordan Peterson have to offer to education? Or are educators just tired of ``philosophising''? This paper does not focus specifically on the debate between Slavoj \v Zi\v zek and Jordan Peterson, but on the concept of interdisciplinary dialogue as a method for designing innovation that the debate has exemplified. The paper will discuss the process of innovation and will illustrate examples developed by the author together with her postgraduate students. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the point that a lot can be learned about second language and literacy pedagogy when researchers do not hide behind the illusory walls of disciplines but, instead, venture out to better understand what they do and why.},

Dramatic productions like Rajiv Joseph's Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (2009) highlight the consequences of war on the ecosystem of the conflict-stricken vicinity of Baghdad city. In the play, the chaotic world portrayed is an ecocentric site where the ghost of a tiger talks and the destruction of the garden, of Baghdad city and of human values are lamented. To illustrate the hazards of human conflict, Joseph incorporates ancient myths with the tragedy of the Iraq war to raise issues related to Eco-theology, Zoo-criticism, Speciesism, Green Criticism, Eco-Feminism and Environmental Racism against the backdrop of the Iraq War. The author integrates Grail legends, Greek mythology and monotheistic religious texts in the play's structure to draw attention to the impending environmental doom. For example, the garden in the play reminds us of Biblical gardens, the assault of a virgin brings to mind Ovid's story of Philomela's rape, and the quest for a golden toilet seat in the desert is a clear indication of the Grail motif in the play's narrative. All these instances insinuate the embedded mythical patterns and the current era's indifference to the safety of our fellow species. Moreover, the play does not only hint at war crimes, but also refers to the overall structure of the world as an outcome of human negligence and insensitivity towards the environment. In short, the play is a myth-ecological narrative of the dilapidated ecology of the contemporary world.},

They either attempt to isolate some quality or set of qualities shared by all evil actions that is not found in other wrongful actions, or they concede that their account of evil is only distinguished by capturing the very worst acts on the scale of moral wrongness. The idea that evil is qualitatively distinct from wrongdoing has recently been under contention. We explore the grounds for this contention, and argue that there is a third option that might be useful for a variety of philosophical accounts of evil. The alternate form of distinctness we propose is called quality of emphasis distinctness (QE distinctness). We illustrate this form of concept distinctness with a modified version of Hillel Steiner's account of evil. We then explain how QE distinctness could also be applied to more complex theories of evil, such as the theories proposed by Claudia Card, John Kekes, and Todd Calder.},

As relatively closed technical systems, apps pose new methodological challenges for sociocultural digital media research. This article describes a method, grounded in a combination of science and technology studies with cultural studies, through which researchers can perform a critical analysis of a given app. The method involves establishing an app's environment of expected use by identifying and describing its vision, operating model and modes of governance. It then deploys a walkthrough technique to systematically and forensically step through the various stages of app registration and entry, everyday use and discontinuation of use. The walkthrough method establishes a foundational corpus of data upon which can be built a more detailed analysis of an app's intended purpose, embedded cultural meanings and implied ideal users and uses. The walkthrough also serves as a foundation for further user-centred research that can identify how users resist these arrangements and appropriate app technology for their own purposes.},

  abstract = {The steadily increasing popularity of computer games has led to the rise of a multi-billion dollar industry. Due to the scale of the computer game industry, developing a successful game is challenging. In addition, prior studies show that gamers are extremely hard to please, making the quality of games an important issue. Most online game stores allow users to review a game that they bought. Such reviews can make or break a game, as other potential buyers often base their purchasing decisions on the reviews of a game. Hence, studying game reviews can help game developers better understand user concerns, and further improve the user-perceived quality of games. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of the reviews of 6224 games on the Steam platform, one of the most popular digital game delivery platforms, to better understand if game reviews share similar characteristics with mobile app reviews, and thereby understand whether the conclusions and tools from mobile app review studies can be leveraged by game developers. In addition, new insights from game reviews could possibly open up new research directions for research of mobile app reviews. We first conduct a preliminary study to understand the number of game reviews and the complexity to read through them. In addition, we study the relation between several game-specific characteristics and the fluctuations of the number of reviews that are received on a daily basis. We then focus on the useful information that can be acquired from reviews by studying the major concerns that users express in their reviews, and the amount of play time before players post a review. We find that game reviews are different from mobile app reviews along several aspects. Additionally, the number of playing hours before posting a review is a unique and helpful attribute for developers that is not found in mobile app reviews. Future longitudinal studies should be conducted to help developers and researchers leverage this information. Although negative reviews contain more valuable information about the negative aspects of the game, such as mentioned complaints and bug reports, developers and researchers should also not ignore the potentially useful information in positive reviews. Our study on game reviews serves as a starting point for other game review researchers, and suggests that prior studies on mobile app reviews may need to be revisited.},

Although most of these existing works focus on game adaptation based on player's performance, affective state experienced by the players could play a key role in gaming experience and may provide a useful indicator for a DDA mechanism. In this article, an affect-based DDA was designed and implemented for computer games. In this DDA mechanism, a player's physiological signals were analyzed to infer his or her probable anxiety level, which was chosen as the target affective state, and the game difficulty level was automatically adjusted in real time as a function of the player's affective state. Peripheral physiological signals were measured through wearable biofeedback sensors and several physiological indices were explored to determine their correlations with anxiety. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the affect-based DDA on game play by comparing it with a performance-based DDA. This is the first time, that is known, that the impact of a real-time affect-based DDA has been demonstrated experimentally.},

The case study analysis presents that the Japanese game develops game narratives and mechanics close to the image they have of their traditional culture and medieval history. On the other hand, the Western triple-A game gives an image of medieval Japan with codes familiar to a foreign audience but shows historical inaccuracy and anachronism. The future work will involve qualitative methods of players to understand their perception and perspective toward the representation of medieval Japan.},

To discuss these points, the article draws upon data from a survey of 331 EUIV players and an Australian university case study involving 18 participants as well as other games studies research. The article explores how players, through their gameplay in a vast historical game world, encounter and gain some degree of familiarity with histories unknown to them. These newly encountered nations and histories confront players with new depictions about the past and may act as a catalyst for player curiosity and conducting historical research outside the game. The player then returns to the game, integrating their external historical research from outside of the game with their own historical experiences in-game, meaningfully connecting the two history mediums. The article builds on other learning models and highlights the play, encounter, and a research learning model where players learn history both inside and outside EUIV. The play, encounter, and research model places greater emphasis on the importance of player's encountering new information inside the game and their curiosity about this new information prompting further research outside the game. This kind of in-game and external player engagement with EUIV and history can form a component of a larger whole of an informal learning of history with engagement of other gaming practices and historical sources.},

  abstract = {Video games are viewed with ambivalence, even as they gain increasing cultural currency. Like the novel before them, video games are hailed both as dangerous, corrupting influences and as invaluable components in a modern education. In either case, the shared hope and dread is in games' ability to shape and produce subjects, a capacity alleged also to their novelistic forebears. This article performs a comparative analysis of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe -- widely considered one of the first works of formal realism -- and Mojang's Minecraft -- a game frequently referred to as a `simulated Robinsonade,' definitive in the survival game genre -- identifying, amongst their similarities, a ludic urge already present in the practices of realism, a desire to 'play in the world' of a text, and submerge oneself in a well-developed alternative subjectivity. It demonstrates how video games have taken up the torch of realism, both clarifying this underlying urge to make of novels a kind of game-of-self, as well as pointing to problematic qualities of the subjects they form and inform. Drawing upon Jean Jacques Rousseau's Emile, Jacques Derrida's The Beast \& the Sovereign v. 2, as well as contemporary criticism of games in general and Minecraft in particular, it establishes the realist novel as an individualist subjectivity-generator and locating the continuation of this mode in contemporary gaming, it demonstrates the common formal ambitions of both novels and games as mechanisms for the production of a coherent sovereign selfhood. By analyzing the methods of subjectification at work in each text, as well as the consequence subject's particular characteristics, it both demonstrates the common thread of formal realism through these distinctly modern media, and explores the consequences of the distinctly modern, individual and sovereign, subjects they produce.},

In Openness, Secrecy, Authorship: Technical Arts and the Culture of Knowledge from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Pamela Long combines intellectual history with the history of science and technology to explore the culture of authorship. Using classical Greek as well as medieval and Renaissance European examples, Long traces the definitions, limitations, and traditions of intellectual and scientific creation and attribution. She examines these attitudes as they pertain to the technical and the practical. Although Long's study follows a chronological development, this is not merely a general work. Long is able to examine events and sources within their historical context and locale. By looking at Aristotelian ideas of Praxis, Techne, and Episteme. She explains the tension between craft and ideas, authors and producers. She discusses, with solid research and clear prose, the rise, wane, and resurgence of priority in the crediting and lionizing of authors. Long illuminates the creation and re-creation of ideas like "trade secrets," "plagiarism," "mechanical arts," and "scribal culture." Her historical study complicates prevailing assumptions while inviting a closer look at issues that define so much of our society and thought to this day. She argues that "a useful working definition of authorship permits a gradation of meaning between the poles of authority and originality," and guides us through the term's nuances with clarity rarely matched in a historical study.},

Its primary example is the Organization for Transformative Works, a successful advocacy group for creative media fans whose main project has been an online fan fiction archive. I am concerned both with this public face and with the activities that fans would prefer to keep out of the official record. For scholars of subcultural artistic and cultural production, the mixed blessings of conservation and legitimacy are necessary considerations for the archiving and meaning-making work of cultural theory. Paying attention to the technological and social specificities that contextualize fandom as a digital archive culture, I trace contradictions and contestations around what fannish and scholarly archivable content is and should be: what's trivial, what's significant, what legally belongs to whom, and what deserves to be preserved.},

This article provides a critical review of existing research applying mediatization of religion theory, focusing on key issues raised by its critics as well as how the theory have moved the research field forward. These issues concern the concept of religion, institution and social change, religious authority, and the application of mediatization theory outside the North-Western European context where it originated. The article argues that an institutional approach to mediatization is a relevant tool for analyzing change as a dynamic process in which the logics of particular forms of media influence practices, values and relations within particular manifestations of religion across various levels of analysis.},

Study 2 followed a group of 26~s~year outdoor students on a 5~day glacier course (10 event measures), which gave 260 single reports (100\%). Multiple regression analysis, all with challenges, skills and the interaction between challenges and skills as the independent variables gave no support to the challenge skill ratio on subjective experiences, explaining on average 9 and 14~\% of a scope of positive and negative experiences in Study 1 and Study 2 respectively. In Study 1, the experience fluctuation model (EFM) explained 2~\% of the variance in a variable measuring pleasure and 3~\% of the variance in an interest variable. In study 2, the EFM explained 12.7~\% of the variance in the pleasure variable and 10.8~\% of the variance in the interest variable. Neither of our flow indicators peaked in the balance condition of challenges and skills. Rather, empirical support was given for an imbalance model of challenges and skills. The findings contest the widespread idea that flow is produced when challenges and skills are harmonized.},

  abstract = {Ruins are increasingly sites of interest in popular culture and scholarly settings, with recent academic thought surrounding ruination frequently crossing disciplinary lines. This includes work by human geographers reflecting on their experiences of walking through ruinous landscapes. By turning attention to the work of Tim Edensor and Jonathan Brettell, this article considers their ideas in the context of contemporary video games, using textual analysis to unpack the fantastical futures of Guerrilla Games' Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) and its recent sequel Horizon Forbidden West (2022). Horizon Zero Dawn has been described as a `techno-fantasy' (Maher n.p.), blending elements from classic fantasy novels and post-apocalypse film (Hudgins n.p.). These open-world role playing games are set in a post-apocalyptic United States, amidst landscapes strewn with debris left behind by the Old Ones. The player takes control of an outcast named Aloy, who sets out to solve the mysteries of the Old Ones and their technology, all while directing her on quests through a world overrun by strange animal-like machines. In considering the ruins of the Horizon games, this article develops the ideas of others: ``that ruins might be one avenue through which to detect critical potential in games'' (Fraser 178). On the whole, this article examines how Edensor's and Brettell's experiences of ruins compare to those in computer-generated settings, while thinking more broadly about the differences and similarities between physical and virtual ruins. In doing so, specific attention is given to how players traverse Horizon's ruins, how game design curates the players' experiences of ruination, and how encountering entropy provides an opportunity to reflect upon the future. Beyond these discussions, this article works to demonstrate the utility of fantasy media in interdisciplinary work, arguing that Horizon offers players an opportunity to engage with distinct entropic landscapes and to reflect on Earth's ecological well-being.},

While in the past most studies focused on parasocial relationships, the new Banks-Bowman social categorization system provides a beneficial and enlightening new framework with which to examine how the player relates to the avatar. The interactive mediums through which players relate with playable characters separate such relationships from those created with film or literary protagonists. This interactivity allows for social player-avatar relationships, including the avatar-as-social-other relationship exemplified in the game Thomas Was Alone, and creates new possibilities important for game designers to consider. This article first briefly explores the academic discussions surrounding the player-avatar relationship in light of the new Banks-Bowman categories, then turns attention to the ways in which the avatar-as-social-other relationship and its corresponding emotionally intense gameplay are exemplified in the game Thomas Was Alone.},

Through a close comparative analysis and reading of BioShock: Infinite (Irrational Games 2013), The Last of Us (Naughty Dog 2013), and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (CD Projekt RED 2015), this paper examines the narrative, representational, and procedural elements which frame fatherhood in these three popular games. Relying upon the foundations of procedural rhetoric and the concept of hegemonic masculinities, this paper focuses on three key themes: paternal violence, anti-fathers, and exceptional daughters. The different ways these themes are represented in the three games highlights how they respectively reinforce, restore, and challenge notions of patriarchal authority, the role of the father, and contemporary gender ideologies.},

Based on semi-structured qualitative interviews with different European, Asian and North American historical game developers, I make the case for how materialist and cultural aspects of videogame development reinforce existing mnemonic hegemony and in turn how this mnemonic hegemony determines access to the production of memory- making potentials that players of videogames activate and negotiate. My interview findings illustrate how individual workers do not necessarily intend to reproduce received systems of power and hegemony, and instead how certain cultural and material relations tacitly motivate and/or marginalise workers in the videogame industries to reproduce hegemonic power relations in cultural memory across race, class and gender. Finally, I develop the argument that access to cultural production networks such as the games industry constitutes important factors that need to be taken seriously in research on cultural memory and game studies. Thus, my article investigates global power relationships, political economy, colonial legacies and cultural hegemony within the videogame industry, and how these are instantiated in individual instances of game developers.},

  abstract = {This dissertation investigates the relation between digital games and common understandings of the past, which people experience through popular culture, formally called 'cultural memory processes'. Typically, so-called historical digital games depict historical scenarios such as World War II, the Cold War, and more recently, the War on Terror, as also seen in major film productions, TV series, and literature. However, at the same time, some historical digital games also manage to go beyond these conventional norms by allowing players to experience, for example, the transatlantic slave trade in the 18th century, or the American civil rights movement in the 1960s. The dissertation therefore raises the question of which understandings and subject-positions digital games systematically promote and invite to understand the past.    The research findings demonstrate that games' formal devices, such as game mechanics, representation, and physical instantiation, motivate distinct understandings of history. By analyzing these formal devices, the dissertation contributes new knowledge on the role of digital games in the larger picture of cultural commemorative processes. On the one hand, the dissertation conducts a qualitative, formal analysis of the digital games Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry and Mafia III, and on the other, a quantitative content analysis of 208 different historical digital games. The close readings of the two games identify their meaning-potentials through which they are analyzed for their possible impact on memory-making processes. In turn, the quantitative analysis highlights the dataset's dominant representations of the past. Here, general trends of historical representation emerge, where whiteness, masculinity, and simple violence are most common, the larger the production budget of each historical game. Therefore, the dissertation investigates how digital games systematically promote and invite specific understandings of the past on both a micro and macro-level of analysis, accomplished through the close readings and the quantitative analysis.    The research project also contextualizes its findings with attention to the contexts of production and reception of historical digital games. Firstly, the dissertation identifies the unstable working conditions, the economic structures, the technical challenges, and the social norms through which the digital games industry operates. These aspects highlight how digital games often develop games according to profit-maximizing purposes. Consequently, such games often represent dominant representations of the past, in which North American or European white men perform simplified violence against others. These dominant representations are encoded as meaning-potentials in the games themselves, whereby formal game analysis helps to identify them.    Secondly, the dissertation shifts focus to the practices of play that negotiate these dominant representations of the past. In this context, players activate, negotiate, or oppose the meaning-potentials in order to express their own personal values via the game's formal devices. Based on Stuart Hall's Encoding / Decoding model, the dissertation shows how the communication process between the games industry and the players themselves is discursive, dynamic, and negotiable.   Overall, the dissertation identifies the economic, technical, and social processes undergirding the production of historical digital games, which predispose developers to encode dominant representations of the past as the game's meaning-potentials. These meaning-potentials are analyzed through a formal game analysis with an emphasis on the formal devices that contribute to historical beliefs. Simultaneously, the dissertation highlights that these significant potentials are only actualized through practices of play, where players activate, negotiate, or even oppose the dominant representations of the past that historical digital games usually follow. In doing so, the dissertation unveils the movement of cultural commemorative processes across production, game form, and practices play in historical digital games.},

In narrative they are primarily armor for warring purposes, serving as highly technological protective suits for police or armies, as modes of transport and air travel, and, most significant, as containers for spiritual and physical transcendence for the pilots or operators who control them. As visual images, they are nearly always masculine in form: heavily decked out in idealized weaponry, with each giant muscle of the male form exaggerated and abstracted into sculptural plates of metal that are streamlined into a dynamic composition of hypostatized masculinity.},

The following databases were searched on October 2, 2021: Medline, Psychinfo, SportDiscus, Web of Science, and CINAHL. The risk of bias of cross-sectional study was assessed by using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies with attrition bias added for longitudinal studies. The results of all included studies were synthesized using narrative synthesis. Meta-analysis was utilized to synthesis the findings of the studies that had sufficient degree of statistical and methodological homogeneity. Eighteen studies were included in this systematic review, which comprised of 20,372 participants. The narrative synthesis showed mixed findings on the relationship between video game participation and loneliness. Meta-analysis that was conducted to nine cross-sectional studies revealed that video game participation was positively and weakly associated with loneliness (               r               = 0.10, 95\% CI = 0.03--0.17). Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies demonstrated serious risk of bias with the addition of serious inconsistency of findings from cross-sectional studies. The existing literature is equivocal in terms of making a definitive judgment on the association between video game participation and loneliness.

It examines a subcultural community---the queer-fantasy community---on Chinese social media to expound how members of this community interpreted China's censorship policy, interacted based on the interpretation, and participated in censorship. Integrating structural topic modeling and emergent coding, this study finds that a political environment of uncertainty fostered divergent imaginaries about censorship. These imaginaries encouraged participatory censorship within the online community, which strengthened the political control of the Internet in the absence of the state. This study illuminates how participatory censorship works, especially in non-professional and non-politically mobilized online communities. With a focus on social media users, it also offers a lens for future research to compare peer-based surveillance and content moderation in authoritarian and democratic contexts.},

The examples from four continents range from the medieval Middle East - already shaken by a convergence of ecological and social disaster - to modern imaginary constructions of medieval Vikings, the persistence of Indigenous knowledge in the Arctic, literary poetics of patrimony, and the heritage politics of Mediterranean urban architecture. Authors ask which strategies societies in developing countries use to defend their cultural and ecological uniqueness and integrity while being penetrated by environmental hazards and hegemonizing 'Western' forms of heritage culture; or how western societies construct their own past in ways that are sometimes reminiscent of traditional imaginations of a pre-modern past, petrified eternally in an 'ideal' moment of time. Colonial and historical forms of 'heritagization' of human and non-human environments, the essays show, answer to pressing emotional needs for a sense of stability. But the desire for nostalgia, frequently commodified, tends to collide with the similarly pressing need for political and economic survival in a rapidly changing world and in the face of accelerating extraction practices. Without being able to solve this dilemma, the volume makes an interdisciplinary contribution to taking intellectual stake of the asymmetrical politics and poetics of heritage and collective cultural memory.},

The  logic  of  mytho\-logical thinking operates within conspiracy theories, with their organizing prin\-ciple of homomorphic resemblance. Conspiracy theories do not interpret events as a coincidence, but rather as being motivated by one originary cause -- evil. The non\-mythological  type  of  signification  also  functions  in  the  logic  of  conspiracy  theories.  This  leads  to  the  perception  of  the  conspirers  as  a  strictly  organized  group,  divided  into  complex  sub\-systems.  The  main  goal  of  this  article  is  to  ex\-plain  the  interaction  between  these  two  contradictory  signification\-tendencies,  for that the concept of code\-text is used.

In Game Poems: Videogame Design as Lyric Practice, independent game designer Jordan Magnuson explores the convergences between game making and lyric poetry and makes the surprising proposition that videogames can operate as a kind of poetry apart from any reliance on linguistic signs or symbols. This rigorous and accessible short book first examines characteristics of lyric poetry and explores how certain videogames can be appreciated more fully when read in light of the lyric tradition---that is, when read as ``game poems.'' Magnuson then lays groundwork for those wishing to make game poems in practice, providing practical tips and pointers along with tools and resources. Rather than propose a monolithic framework or draw a sharp line between videogame poems and poets and their nonpoetic counterparts, Game Poems brings to light new insights for videogames and for poetry by promoting creative dialogue between disparate fields. The result is a lively account of poetic game-making praxis.},

It departs from an analysis of an online debate on racial representation in the game as a possible act of epistemic disobedience, and moves on to a consideration of three narrative aspects of the game itself: its representation of political struggle, the ideological stance of the protagonist, and ethnic inspirations in worldbuilding. By referring those three issues to postcolonial analyses of Polish culture, as well as Walter D. Mignolo's concept of decolonization through epistemic disobedience, this article aims to demonstrate paradoxical qualities of the game, which tries to simultaneously distance itself from the established, West-oriented ways of knowledge production and gain recognition as an artifact of modern Western pop culture. Moreover, it employs the tradition of Polish Romanticism to establish itself as a bridge between Slavdom and Western culture, and strengthen the colonial idea of Poland being the proper ruler over Slavs.},

  abstract = {Barely 50 years old, video games are among the newest media today, and still a source of fascination and a site of anxiety for cultural critics and parents. Since the 1970s, a generation of video gamers have grown up and as they began to have children of their own, video games have become objects evoking fond memories of the past. Nostalgia for simpler times is evident in the aesthetic choices game designers make: pixelated graphics, 8-bit music, and frustratingly hard levels are all reminiscent of arcade-style and third-generation console games that have been etched into the memory of Generation X. At the same time, major AAA titles have become so photorealistic and full of cinematic ambition that video games can also serve as vehicles for nostalgia by ``faithfully'' recreating the past. From historical recreations of major cities in the Assassin's Creed series and L. A. Noire, to the resurrection of old art styles in 80 Days, Firewatch or Cuphead all speak of the extent to which computer gaming is suffused with a longing for pasts that never were but might have been. This paper investigates the design of games to examine how nostalgia is used to manipulate affect and player experience, and how it contributes to the themes that these computer games explore. Far from ruining video games, nostalgia nonetheless exploits the associations the players have with certain historical eras, including earlier eras of video gaming. Even so, the juxtaposition of period media and dystopic rampages or difficult levels critically comment upon the futility of nostalgia.},

  abstract = {An analysis of the game engine Unreal through feminist, race, and queer theories of technology and media, as well as a critique of the platform studies framework itself.             In this first scholarly book on the Unreal game engine, James Malazita explores one of the major contemporary game development platforms through feminist, race, and queer theories of technology and media, revealing how Unreal produces, and is produced by, broader intersections of power. Enacting Platforms takes a novel critical platform studies approach, raising deeper questions: what are the material and cultural limits of platforms themselves? What is the relationship between the analyst and the platform of study, and how does that relationship in part determine what ``counts'' as the platform itself? Malazita also offers a forward-looking critique of the platform studies framework itself.             The Unreal platform serves as a kind of technical and political archive of the games industry, highlighting how the techniques and concerns of games have shifted and accreted over the past 30 years. Today, Unreal is also used in contexts far beyond games, including in public communication, biomedical research, civil engineering, and military simulation and training. The author's depth of technical analysis, combined with new archival findings, contributes to discussions of topics rarely covered in games studies (such as the politics of graphical rendering algorithms), as well as new readings of previously ``closed'' case studies (such as the engine's entanglement with the US military and American masculinity in America's Army). Culture, Malazita writes, is not ``built into'' software but emerges through human practices with code.},

  abstract = {AI chatbots and LLMs have made a significant impact in a short time. Despite their benefits, they pose serious threats to academic integrity and ethics by generating human-like text, which is very hard to detect. Various AI-detection tools have been developed to tackle this issue. However, their effectiveness is questionable. This study investigates the performance of four AI-detection tools (Turnitin, ZeroGPT, GPTZero, and Writer AI) in detecting AI-generated text. That text was generated using three LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini). Furthermore, three adversarial techniques (edited through Grammarly, paraphrased through Quillbot, and 10\%-20\% editing by a human expert) were applied to see their effects on the performance of AI-detection tools. Turnitin turned out to be the most accurate and consistent one, with a 100\% AI score even with the adversarial techniques. ZeroGPT and GPTZero also reported relatively high AI scores, especially with the original files and the first and third adversarial techniques. Among the three adversarial techniques, paraphrasing through Quillbot affected the performance of three AI-detection tools (ZeroGPT, GPTZero, and Writer AI) the most. Among the three LLMs, text generated through Perplexity was more accurately detected, while Gemini-generated text showed a relatively lower AI score. What was the most note-worthy was the fact that in many cases, even when the text was generated through the same LLM, and detected through the same AI-detection tool; different files showed different AI scores, further highlighting the inconsistencies among AI-detection tools.},

  abstract = {The Book of John Mandeville has tended to be neglected by modern teachers and scholars, yet this intriguing and copious work has much to offer the student of medieval literature, history, and culture. 1 The Book of John Mandeville was a contemporary bestseller, providing readers with exotic information about locales from Constantinople to China and about the social and religious practices of peoples such as the Greeks, Muslims, and Brahmins. The Book first appeared in the middle of the fourteenth century and by the next century could be found in an extraordinary range of European languages: not only Latin, French, German, English, and Italian, but also Czech, Danish, and Irish. Its wide readership is also attested by the two hundred and fifty to three hundred medieval manuscripts that still survive today. One scholar even insists that ``few literate men in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries could have avoided coming across the Travels at some time.'' 2 Among others, Chaucer borrowed from it, as did the Gawain-poet in the Middle English Cleanness, and its popularity continued long after the Middle Ages; there were early printed editions in various Continental languages, often, as in many manuscripts, with illustrations. Christopher Columbus apparently consulted the work, as did Sir Walter Ralegh; there were English editions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and in his great Dictionary, Samuel Johnson praised the work for its ``force of thought and beauty of expression.'' 3},

While dismissible as the latest ``toxic technoculture'' (               Massanari 2015               ), the \#TorrentialDownpour campaign's claims are not unfounded; there are links between localization and censorship, in that both practices adapt texts moving between markets and cultures. This article draws from translation theory and observations of localization practice to problematize \#TorrentialDownpour's claims, and in the process address some of the most prevalent fallacies involving game localization: localization is not censorship; there is no better version; and one person is not ruining gamers' fun.},

Ephemerality-based affordances are attracting growing attention as they allow users to maintain a delicate balance between information disclosure and privacy protection in the social media world. Despite its high practical relevance, few studies have provided insight into how ephemerality-presented information disclosure impacts users' self-disclosure intentions on the basis of a cost-benefit trade-off. This study sought to fill this gap under the structure of privacy calculus theory to determine the influence of ephemerality on the tension between information-privacy concerns and information disclosure. This study developed a theoretical model integrating perceived ephemerality and tested it using online survey data collected from 302 ``Visible to Friends'' active Chinese users in eight Chinese universities. The results confirmed that individuals' perceptions of the ephemerality of technology features significantly impacted users' self-disclosure intentions by counteracting perceived severity and perceived intrusion concerning privacy risks. Furthermore, perceived ephemerality was shown to positively predict the constructs of benefits, including perceived usefulness and perceived controllability, to significantly affect self-disclosure intentions. Results are validated in an ephemeral social media context, WeChat Moments, and the theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Structured around three phases-introduction, collaboration, and feedback-, the game uses large language models (LLMs) to simulate varying emotional states in NPCs, from neutrality to expressions of anger, joy, and more. Players' emotional responses to the game play and interaction with the NPCs are captured through the dialogue they input. Language models are used to extract emotion scores from these in-game conversations. This study aims to enhance our understanding of emotional dynamics within gaming environments, in order to further inform the design of emotionally engaging experiences. Additionally, it underscores the potential of language models for scientific inquiries in human-computer interaction.},

It will be argued that Mass Effect's choice-based narrative conditions its notion of history as an individually driven process whose changes are manifested in the short duration and that its hypothetical future is consonant with some of contemporaneity's anxieties about its place in history.},

According to international agreements between the space-faring nations of the world, the bodies of the Solar System are the province of all humanity, and are made off-limits to imperialist annexation. Because of this, it might be thought that extraterrestrial space exploration and exploitation must be undertaken only for the benefit of all nations. Unfortunately, those charged with interpreting these agreements often do so in ways that generally discourage equitable distribution of space resources, and instead promote neo-imperialistic attitudes toward developing and settling space. Given the grand technotopian rhetoric emerging from the space industrialists, such as Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Elon Musk, and from science fiction soap operas like Star Trek---where we are told all humanity will share in the final frontier---it can also be seen as a betrayal of the humanitarian ideals of spaceflight.},

The landscape is encountered in the sublime mode, understood here through Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant, in that it emphasizes an incomprehensible largeness and expanse. This lends the game's moral framework an epic grandeur. But as the landscape becomes more familiar to the player it tends to migrate from the sublime to the picturesque mode, a waning that may be read in relation to the game's resolution of its narrative conflict.},

Looking at the complex arrangement formed by so-called human and nonhuman counterparts in networked settings, I analyze an intimate moment hosted by the selected erotic platform, observing how a sex toy that can be controlled by distance modulates the affective underpinnings of such ``vibrant'' assemblage and participates in this carnal activity by heightening and clustering different groupings of bodies to create an orgasmic moment. Drawing on Actor--Network Theory and theories of affect, I focus on the sociotechnical affordances that constitute this sexual setting and describe the movement of actants as they throb to develop senses of intimacy and presence in the unfurling event, thus showing how a great number of players, from varied scopes of intelligibility, participate jointly to develop visceral affect and body friction even though they do not share the same spatial frame.},

  abstract = {Sir G aw ain and the Green K night is still generally thought to be a conservative work, secure in its endorsem ent o f aristocratic ideals and practices. But the poem is split---like the notorious Green Knight, whose physical breaking and disfigurement is the dom inant act and im age o f the romance. Sadly, it is not even possible to speak of him w ithout qualification, for he is not one, but two: the antic knight and the respectable Lord o f Hautdesert, Bertilak. Herein lies the historical contradiction that the poem seeks, unsuccessfully, to reconcile. The medieval noblem an contains two m odes o f existence: the feudal servant, w hose martial skills and energies are utilized by a dom inant lord; and the landowner intent on his own independence and prosperity. And, through the device of the knightly test, the poem produces two conflicting meanings reflecting these positions. W hen the Green Knight com es to Camelot proposing an exchange of blows, the explicit purpose of the game is to see whether the knight who takes up his offer---striking an ax blow on condition of rendering him self up to a return blow the next year---will keep his word and thereby enact his traw th e. But there is, necessarily, an im plicit (and contrary) message: since the extent of a knight's tra w th e is also the extent of his w illingness to hazard him self for no real purpose at all, magnanimity can just as easily appear as mystification. We see this in the Green Knight's consum m ate nonchalance toward his decapitation, and in Gawain's unwavering com m itm ent to this lethal pact. This dissertation shows that the exchange of blows is m erely an exaggeration of real chivalric violence, which as a form of courtly play idealizes its discomfiting m aterialities---often to the detrim ent of the very aristocrats who practice and prom ote it.},

In particular, this piece focuses on the ways in which Reddit's karma point system, aggregation of material across subreddits, ease of subreddit and user account creation, governance structure, and policies around offensive content serve to provide fertile ground for anti-feminist and misogynistic activism. The ways in which these events and communities reflect certain problematic aspects of geek masculinity are also considered. This research is informed by the results of a long-term participant-observation and ethnographic study into Reddit's culture and community and is grounded in actor-network theory.},

  abstract = {The question of whether and how digital media use and digital communication affect people's and particularly adolescents' well-being has been investigated for several decades. Many studies have analyzed how different forms of digital communication influence loneliness and life satisfaction, two comparatively stable cognitive indicators of subjective well-being. Despite this large body of empirical work, the findings remain ambivalent, with studies resulting in positive, negative, or nonsignificant effects. Several meta-analyses suggest that the overall effect of digital communication on life satisfaction is probably too small to suggest a detrimental effect. The net effect of digital communication on loneliness, by contrast, is positive, but likewise small. Yet the studies on which these meta-analyses are based suffer from several limitations. They often adopt a limited perspective on the phenomenon of interest as a disproportionate amount of work focuses on interpersonal differences instead of intra-individual, contextual, and situational effects, as well as their interactions. Furthermore, studies are often based on cross-sectional data, use unvalidated and imprecise measurements, and differ greatly in how they conceptualize digital communication. The diversity in studied applications and forms of digital communication also suggests that effects are most likely bidirectional. Passive digital communication (e.g., browsing and lurking) is more likely to result in negative effects on well-being. Active and purposeful digital communication (e.g., posting, liking, conversating), by contrast, is more likely to result in positive effects. Future research should therefore investigate how the various levels of digital communication (including differences in devices, applications, features, interactions, and messages) interact in shaping individuals' well-being. Instead of expecting long-term effects on comparatively stable cognitive indicators such as life satisfaction, scholars should rather study and identify the spatial and temporal boundaries of digital communication effects on the more fluctuating affective components of well-being.},

  abstract = {The paper reflects on public discourses about science and pseudoscience, proposing the same discursive structure for both---the Esperantist-Epideictic genre. This genre of discourse might bring together characteristics that we understand as constituents of the public discourse on science. It also enables us to depict the process by which to maintain cohesion on a group's values. The discursive activity points to science as neutral, free, and independent of social influences captivating those already in this discursive sphere. The discursive hermeticity appears in the Esperantist content and the Epideictic form by avoiding the dialogical situations where there is no epistemological and axiological dispute. We thus, show that the Esperantist-Epideictic genre helps to understand the process of maintaining a cohesive group whose beliefs about the Flat Earth appear in social media. We use data from three sources: transcriptions from seminars held at that 1st FlatCon Brazil, most viewed videos on YouTube where affirmationists talk about Flat Earth, and semi-structured exploratory interviews conducted at FlatCon. Our findings indicate that some conceptions of validation of knowledge, scientific method, science bias, reality, and truth compound a distinct part in the current conversations about the Flat Earth movement. Moreover, the Esperantist-Epideictic genre of discourse can be an analytical tool for framing the echo chamber in social media while defending or attacking the Flat Earth movement. We conclude that in a time where there is a growing consensus that science is under attack, the ways in which its defenders are trying to stand up to it may be causing some harm.},

To this end, the game -- to a much greater extent than the novel, but also in parallel with it -- turns the trope of a heroic, paternalistic, and withdrawn masculinity inside out, by means of feminine corporeality, and through feminine politics (which can be simply defined as politics practiced by women and with women's interest in mind, and set to undermine masculine hegemony). The above leads to an examination and rejection of the masculine trope, which is replaced with an identity located between femininity and masculinity (and different variants thereof).},

We specifically draw from the relevant research on historical sources as tools for the development of historical thinking skills, aiming at the creation of communities of practice among students who are encouraged to adopt practices such as those of professional historians, namely primary sources analysis and interpretation. Results of observation and questionnaire analysis indicate that primary school students (aged 11 years old) can use an educational computer game as a tool for conducting historical source analysis under specific conditions.},

Analyzing player-generated paratexts from online game communities reveals that while many players aspire toward ecocentric city designs, they instead inadvertently restage the asymmetric planetary relationship emblematic of our current era. Our analysis uncovers the capital-driven assumptions that characterize human--environment relations in the game. Attempts at ecocentric aesthetics invariably subsumed by cybernetic interactions that privilege the Anthropocene's prevailing power dynamics. These expressions highlight the inherent contradictions of the Anthropocene era as encountered in Cities: Skylines and illustrate the permeability between the contemporary material world and digital play.},

A multidisciplinary group of scholarly experts takes up some of the most intriguing scientific, spiritual, trade/commercial, and even military dimensions of the complex entanglements of religion and outer space. Attending to the historical reality that the interconnections between religion and the heavens are as old as religions themselves, the volume starts with an examination of "outer space" elements in the most sacred writings of the world's religions. It then explores some of the religious questions inevitable in this encounter, analyzing cultural constructions (both literary and actual) of religion and outer space. It ends with examinations of the role of religion in the very real and very present business of space exploration. What might motivate the spread of religion (or at least fantasies of religion in its myriad possibilities) into new interior and exterior dimensions of the cosmos? Only the future will tell. Religion and Outer Space is essential reading for students and academics with an interest in religion and space, religion and science, space exploration, religion and science fiction, popular culture, and religion in America"--},

It is, apparently, an extensive catalogue of bad arguments by disgraceful sophists; but its complex composition suggests that this focuses attention on the shape and nature of argument---attention that some think Plato is incapable of giving. He uses the idiom of games, and of seriousness and play, to provoke reflection on logical and syntactic structure and their normative features; but to see how he does so we need to consider the complex background of the fiction of a Platonic dialogue, and its use of surprise and humour. Comparison with the bbc Radio 4 game `Mornington Crescent' might help.},

For history is fundamentally just the communication of the past through a medium (Dening, 2006; Chapman, 2016). That is certainly the case when the most traditional forms of history are crafted by academic historians: books and textbooks. The dominance of text and speech in history classes should not mislead us: they are not the only media for communicating the past and certainly not the only legitimate media (McCall, 2012b). There are many more, and once we leave the realm of academic historians, it's easy to find pretty much everyone doing history in some form. They do this when they tell a story about their day, draw a picture about their vacation, or debate something that happened in their peer group. Film, painting, theater, sculpture, toys, music, even social media can and often do communicate aspects of the past and, when they do, they are history},

The games themselves offer interpretations of the past in the form of simulations. Indeed it is the interactivity inherent to the medium of video games that most shapes how developers take their ideas about documentable history and adapt them for their audience. The participation of players is not limited to playing, however, and passively accepting the play experience. Rather players can and do actively engage not only by implementing their own rules of play and creating mods, but by debating the historical accuracy of the game in the internet forums. In this final arena, the game forum, players engage in their own historical debate and conduct their own form of public history.},

  abstract = {The post-September 11th period has seen a great deal of anxiety over technology even as nostalgia for the early Cold War period attempts to relieve that anxiety through a return to an optimistic appreciation of the potential of technological progress. Computers and computer technology in particular have been the locus for much of this debate, in the form of everything from internet fora to drones, with videogames often coming under specific scrutiny. The ubiquity of visual simulations, their self-referentiality, and their inescapability seem to be proving Baudrillard's warnings about the descent of postmodernity into the "desert of the real." This paper uses the framework of Baudrillard's theories of simulacra and simulation to examine the medial nature of videogames, putting Baudrillard in dialogue with videogame theorists who emphasize the importance of game rules for bringing videogames into the real, and puts both simulacra and rules in conversation with the messages implied by game narratives, to uncover how the medium of the videogame presents a possible way out of the mirror-maze of simulation. Using the Fallout franchise as a test case, this paper examines the workings of Cold War nostalgia within the hyperreal environment of the series, unearthing the cultural concerns that the games' retrofuturist simulacra mask. It then examines the way the games' rule-systems challenge those simulacra, undermining not only the nostalgia they support but the faith in technology they assume. Finally, it explains how the loose narratives of the games create a pervasive atmosphere of distrust of technology that leads players to see through both the embrace of simulacra and the control of rule-systems.},

Goldschmidt's theory of the hopeful monster placed that which is different, changing and monstrous at the heart of evolution. The aim of this article is therefore to examine how macromutation (also known as saltational theory) makes manifest an anxiety, but also an exciting potentiality, about the human's interrelational existence with plant, animal, inanimate and technological life. It moves between Goldschmidt's theories of evolution and cultural representations that resonate with his work to suggest that the hopeful monster questions the dehumanisation of and violence towards different others by bringing monstrous difference to the centre of species' survival. The focus here is how Goldschmidt's ideas reverberate in contemporary culture, particularly how these resonances invite a questioning of the supposed threat of difference to imagined individual and national security and unity. Engaging with the Hollywood film series X-Men and Hiromi Goto's collection of short stories Hopeful Monsters, this article explores how these texts make manifest the ontological anxieties of facing (our) monsters, and thus the environmental and socio-political consequences and potentialities of being of, with and next to difference.},

  abstract = {This article explores representations of history and history for the present in Fallout 4 to illuminate how the gameworld makes clever use of common historical tropes and aesthetics, as well as the genre of the counterfactual in its presentation of a compelling and interactive narrative. Set in the post-apocalyptic landscape of Massachusetts, Fallout 4 employs various sites of historical Massachusetts (Concord, Lexington, Boston) in order to draw the user into the story of the `lone survivor,' the avatar that he or she takes control of. This analysis is interested in the ways that Fallout 4 employs history and the genre of the counterfactual in the production of a compelling narrative that not only invites but impels the player into action to chart a new course for this devastated virtual landscape. The power of counterfactual history lies in its capacity to unravel assumptions about the static nature of historical events, and in its denial of a linear trajectory of history broadly. In the case of Fallout 4, the implementation of a counterfactual story, wherein the nuclear event that shrouded the Cold War period in uncertainty, takes place. It serves as a rejection of the popularly rehearsed narrative of American supremacy triumphing over Communist forces to present the player with a more nuanced interpretation of some of the internal and external tensions that came to define the Cold War period (i.e. cultural malaise, economic instability, the growth of a military-industrial complex). This conflicting presentation of histories both real and imagined provides an opportunity for the player to experience and interact with the game critically as a counterfactual reimagining of the Cold War era. Viewed in this way, the virtual world of Fallout 4 becomes a space where the player can reassess their own understanding of the period, and the nature of historical knowledge production more broadly.},

What makes zombies such widespread symbols of horror and dread, and how have portrayals of zombies in movies changed and evolved to fit contemporary fears, anxieties, and social issues? Zombies have held a unique place in film and popular culture throughout most of the 20th century. Rare in that this enduring monster type originated in non-European folk culture rather than the Gothic tradition from which monsters like vampires and werewolves have emerged, zombies have in many ways superseded these Gothic monsters in popular entertainment and the public imagination and have increasingly been used in discussions ranging from the philosophy of mind to computer lingo to the business press. Zombie Culture brings together scholars from a variety of fields, including cinema studies, popular culture, and video game studies, who have examined the living dead through a variety of lenses. By looking at how portrayals of zombies have evolved from their folkloric roots and entered popular culture, readers will gain deeper insights into what zombies mean in terms of the public psyche, how they represent societal fears, and how their evolving portrayals continue to reflect underlying beliefs of The Other, contagion, and death.},

From early Welsh poetry to the twenty-first century anim\'e series produced by the Fate franchise, the essays in this collection explore the continuities that make the material recognisable in different times and places and the astonishing variety of adaptations that have made the Arthurian story popular in large parts of the world. Divided into 3 main sections: Arthurian Texts and Material Contexts: 600-1600; The European World of Arthur: 1200-1800; Crossing Genres, Crossing Centuries: 1500-2018 the book focuses on the moments of transition in which Arthurian material has moved across temporal, material, and geographical boundaries. Although broadly chronological, the sections are bound together by their thematic focal points and contain different examples of textual and visual representations of Arthur that illustrate the breadth and scope of Arthurian adaptation.},

Close analyses of two live speedruns recorded at the biannual Games Done Quick charity marathon, guided by concepts from Deleuze and Guattari, explain how the player's narrative body, space, and time are impacted by the optimizations and exploits of the Left 4 Dead series' zombie narrative. While the zombie story preprogrammed for players is largely bypassed, speedrunning through the Left 4 Dead series' environments is a generative act of rupture that activates and deepens storytelling tendencies within zombie media that embrace chaos and decay. The speedrun is itself a form of collapse, where scripted meaning and intentionality fall away, replaced by the chance and ephemeral story of an emergent, optimized engagement.},

Most research on the social dynamics of wolf packs, however, has been conducted on non-natural assortments of captive wolves. Here I describe the wolf-pack social order as it occurs in nature, discuss the alpha concept and social dominance and submission, and present data on the precise relationships among members in free-living packs, based on a literature review and 13 summers of observations of wolves on Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. I conclude that the typical wolf pack is a family, with the adult parents guiding the activities of the group in a division-of-labor system in which the female predominates primarily in such activities as pup care and defense and the male primarily during foraging and food-provisioning and the travels associated with them.},

A bestiary, therefore, is a religious text, particularly popular during the Middle Ages. Several beautifully illustrated copies have survived from the 12th and 13th centuries. This Latin bestiary was written and illuminated in England at the end of the 12th century. It is closely related to a slightly earlier book which belonged to Worksop Priory in Nottinghamshire and is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. On the left-hand page, shown here, is a Leucrota, a composite animal said to originate from India. Here it is shown as the size of a donkey, with the hindquarters of a stag and the chest and legs of a lion. The animal also has cloven hooves, the head of a horse and a wide mouth with a large unbroken bone instead of teeth. On the right is an eagle, whose wonderful eyesight enables it to hunt fish from a great height. When its eyes grow dim from old age, it flies into the circle of the sun to clear them and to restore its wings, after which it plunges into the water to restore its youth. In medieval allegory, the eagle can represent Christ, who catches souls as the eagle catches fish.},

It inquires if and in what way a change in hegemonic structures can be observed on the levels of society, characters, and also in terms of the ludic possibilities provided within the game-worlds. In order to do so, two contemporary post-apocalyptic Open World RPGs are analyzed, namely Fallout 4 (2015) and Horizon Zero Dawn (2017). It is evident that Fallout 4 continues a male-connotated line of motives, transpired by past media. Horizon Zero Dawn uses the potential of the apocalypse, the promised restart, to instead generate a new society. This society has not yet achieved a state of equality but has already reached a new baseline of strong characters of different genders without racial disparity, that is further fostered by the protagonist's journey. Hurtful gender tropes are thereby overcome, and stereotypes are being subverted.},

Specifically, the immersive and embodied aspects of videogames allow neurodivergent people to better explain their experiences. However, current research is limited to instrumentalization, by specifically looking for the therapeutic or educational benefits of videogames. I reflect on ethical questions that arise if we try to communicate the embodied experiences related to neurodiversity through videogames. I argue that videogames with the explicit goal to create empathy or care for neurodivergence can also be restrictive. Instead, I put forward attunement as an intersubjective and nonhierarchic mode of affective engagement with neurodiversity through gaming. An analysis of the videogames Unravel and Celeste helps me to illustrate what attunement in a videogame could look like. I conclude that better understanding neurodiversity through play, means ``letting it be'' instead of (re)shaping it to be easily consumable in videogames.},

  abstract = {Virtual space is one of the fundamental building blocks of any digital game. It ties directly into the notions of immersion and interactivity, both of which are enacted in relation to space, and it is therefore one of the components that differentiates the new medium from traditional texts. Over the past decade, the graphical rendering of virtual spaces in digital games has soared to unexpected results, so much so that one might be tempted to define these environments merely in terms of their sensorial representation. My argument, however, is that in addition to audiovisual representation, storytelling is employed by video game developers in order to create meaningful virtual spaces. The aim of the present paper, therefore, is to offer a brief account of current theory on video game spaces, and to add to the latter the idea that narrativity can and, indeed, does participate in the creation of virtual spaces in at least two significant ways. First, I argue that game developers create specific stories which they associate with various game spaces in order to confer meaning upon the latter beyond what can be represented through image and sound. Secondly, I explore the player's experience of such environments and the manner in which personal narratives result from play within certain spaces. To illustrate the above, I turn to 2K Games' BioShock and to Bethesda Softworks' The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, respectively. Ultimately, I propose that through an appropriate use of storytelling, virtual environments can become as meaningful for players as real-life spaces, giving rise to experiences that are no less impactful or memorable than their real-life counterparts.},

  abstract = {This paper examines whether certain computer games, most notably RPGs, can be thought of as examples of the postmodern epic. Drawing on more recent critical frameworks of the epic, such as the ones proposed by Northrop Frye, Adeline Johns-Putra, Catherine Bates or John Miles Foley, the demonstration disembeds the most significant diachronic features of the epic from its two main media of reproduction, that of text and oral transmission, in order to test their fusion with the virtual environment of digital games. More specifically, I employ the concept of ``epic mode'' in order to explain the relevance of The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim for the history of the epic typology, which must now be understood as transmedial. I illustrate the manner in which this representative title assimilates the experience and performance of the epic, as well as several meaningful shifts in terms of genre theory, the most notable of which is an intrinsic posthuman quality. The experience of play inherent to Skyrim does not only validate the latter as an authentic digital epic of contemporary culture, but it also enhances the content, role and impact of the typology itself, which is yet far from falling into disuse.1},

I argue that the game should be thought of as an emblem of the current cultural zeitgeist, in a similar way one might identify something like Jack Kerouac's The Dharma Bums as an emblem of the counter cultural 60s. I argue that the Dark Souls series expresses in allegorical form an anxiety about living in a time where the meaning of our everyday actions and even society itself has become significantly destabilized. It does this through a fractured approach to story-telling, that is interspersed with Buddhist metaphysics and wrapped up in macabre, gothic aesthetic depicting the last gasping breath of a once great kingdom. This expression of contemporary social anxiety is connected to the discourse of postmodernity in Japan. Through looking at these games as a feedback loop between text, environment and ludic system, I connect the main conceptual motifs that structure the games as a whole with Osawa Masachi's concept of the post-fictional era and Hiroki Azuma's definition of the otaku.},

In the case of applications related to medical uses and self-help, it is even more important, given the aims of the application, the diversity of target users and the urgent need for increased retention. In this article, we present a gameful design process for a mobile application targeted toward patients in rehabilitation, implementing concepts related to increasing user rapport and motivation through gamification, and means to offer guidance and personalized services to improve user experience. Both gamification and personalization build on narrative concepts, by putting patients in the place of a ``hero'', offering them the opportunity to overcome ``challenges'' and receive a clear view of their progress (a.k.a. a ``hero's journey''), both in terms of physical and mental condition. Finally, we discuss measurable indicators used to evaluate the application in terms of the progress that patients showed, their motivation and interest, and degree of adherence to the exercise plans.

Why are AI tools so attractive and what are the risks of implementing them across the research pipeline? Here we develop a taxonomy of scientists' visions for AI, observing that their appeal comes from promises to improve productivity and objectivity by overcoming human shortcomings. But proposed AI solutions can also exploit our cognitive limitations, making us vulnerable to illusions of understanding in which we believe we understand more about the world than we actually do. Such illusions obscure the scientific community's ability to see the formation of scientific monocultures, in which some types of methods, questions and viewpoints come to dominate alternative approaches, making science less innovative and more vulnerable to errors. The proliferation of AI tools in science risks introducing a phase of scientific enquiry in which we produce more but understand less. By analysing the appeal of these tools, we provide a framework for advancing discussions of responsible knowledge production in the age of AI.},

Videogames, even though they are the chosen medium of a troubled generation dogged by the political instability of faltering economics, do not attempt at political discontent or relevant social expression on a level even close to other forms.

The following details the development of The Division 2 and the controversies that surrounded it following the critiques of The Division and the developer's insistence on the apolitical nature of their entertainment product. Utilizing Avery Gordon's theory of hauntings, I apply an ethnographic approach to the digital recreation of the D.C. landscape to explore the creative and technical decisions developer Massive Entertainment made in their creation of D.C. to examine the significance of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial's absence in The Division 2. I analyze what the claims to apolitical creation mean in the context of an explicitly ideological game set in the Tom Clancy universe and how this reflects the ways power operates through video games as a means of enforcing American exceptionalism and techno-military fetishism to the detriment of contemporary democratic values in the United States.},

It was an inspiration for the CD Projekt Red\' s games, but the books became bestsellers abroad only after the release of the new Netflix show (The Witcher, Lauren Hissrich, 2019-). The recent developments in the franchise shifted the focus back to the novels. In this paper, I zoom in two ways of experiencing The Witcher: native and international. Firstly, I put my attention to the original texts and describe the duality of the morally ambiguous main character. Geralt is not a hero, nor an anti- hero; his neutrality categorises him as a middle-man, whom I will call a no-hero. Secondly, I write about the saga's Slavic folklore which is mixed with (Western) (anti-)fairy tales and creates an interesting cultural melange. Thirdly and lastly, I look at the whole franchise and analyse both native and foreign reactions to the Netflix show. I discuss elements important to these two audiences and explain the reasons behind The Witcher's Polish-ness. This closer look at the saga's cultural and literary backgrounds explains not only its popularity in Poland but also the reasons behind its re-discovery by foreigners.},

  abstract = {Climate change places major transformational demands on modern societies. Transformations require the capacity to collectively envision and meaningfully debate realistic and desirable futures. Without such a collective imagination capacity and active deliberation processes, societies lack both the motivation for change and guidance for decision-making in a certain direction of change. Recent arguments that science fiction can play a role in societal transformation processes is not yet supported by theory or empirical evidence. Advancing the argument that fiction can support sustainability transformations, this paper makes four contributions. First, building on the imaginary concept, I introduce and define the idea of socio-climatic imaginaries. Second, I develop a theory of imagination as linked cognitive-social processes that enable the creation of collectively shared visions of future states of the world. This theory addresses the dynamics that bridge imagination processes in the individual mind and collective imagining that informs social and political decision-making. Third, emphasizing the political nature of creating and contesting imaginaries in a society, I introduce the role of power and agency in this theory of collective imagination. I argue that both ideational and structural power concepts are relevant for understanding the potential societal influence of climate fiction. Finally, the paper illuminates these different forms of transformational power and agency with two brief case studies: two climate fiction novels. I contrast a dystopian and utopian science fiction novel -- Paolo Bacigalupi's The Water Knife (2015) and Kim Stanley Robinson's Green Earth (2015). The two books are very similar in their power/agency profile, but the comparison provides initial insights into the different roles of optimistic and pessimistic future visions.},

While the image of the so-called fembot or gynoid has historically predominated depictions of these relationships, recent years have seen a parallel proliferation of male artificial lovers, especially in televisual media from around the world. On the one hand, this new wave of `robot rom-coms' reverses the typical gender dynamics of science fiction's long fembot-filled history, bringing fresh perspectives on what it might mean to fall in love with or at least through the algorithm. Yet, alongside the apparent rejection of the artificiality of the self-sacrificing robot lover in favour of the human partner in these narratives, often comes an uncritical acceptance of what we might call an algorithmic ideology. These narratives suggest to their audiences that, even though you might not end up living `happily after-after' with the algorithm, you should still love the algorithm~-- or, more specifically, you should love the algorithmically-powered tech products which help facilitate a genuine `human' connection in these stories.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the impact of using the computer game SimCity™4 in student assignments to develop city and strategic plans. It is conceptualized around Lobo's (2005) critique of SimCity™ as `toying with the city'. Two University of Queensland urban planning classes (one undergraduate, the other postgraduate) were asked to use SimCity™4 to build simulated cities. One class was about building historical urban utopias; the other was about strategic metropolitan planning. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of this use of SimCity™4 to develop students' plan-making skills, and reports on students' assessment of whether and how the game's assumptions forced modifications away from preferred planning outcomes. The paper concludes that, whilst SimCity™4 is indeed based on `toying with the city', city planning practice is increasingly using computer-based simulations (some based on GIS) to toy with future city scenarios to play with and understand the likely outcomes of planning policies. The convergence of the two ideas gives strength to the idea of using computer games like SimCity™4 in planning education.},

This type of games can be applied to various areas such as medicine, psychology and education, as location and spatial characteristics are horizontal to many application domains. This work tries to increase the number of tools available for psychologists by developing location--aware games for promoting physical activity. It also takes advantage of the urban features that make an area an appropriate place for practice moderate physical activity. The paper presents the methodology followed to identify these healthy urban attributes, describes the technical development of the game and the design of an experiment with real users.},

With Playing with the Past, game studies is taken to the next level by offering a specific and detailed analysis of one area of digital game play -- the representation of history. The collection focuses on the ways in which gamers engage with, play with, recreate, subvert, reverse and direct the historical past, and what effect this has on the ways in which we go about constructing the present or imagining a future. What can World War Two strategy games teach us about the reality of this complex and multifaceted period? Do the possibilities of playing with the past change the way we understand history? If we embody a colonialist's perspective to conquer 'primitive' tribes in Colonization, does this privilege a distinct way of viewing history as benevolent intervention over imperialist expansion? The fusion of these two fields allows the editors to pose new questions about the ways in which gamers interact with their game worlds. Drawing these threads together, the collection concludes by asking whether digital games - which represent history or historical change - alter the way we, today, understand history itself"--},

It discusses Pokemon, persona and the Poke Ball and examines how categories of legal personhood trap the non-human within Pokemon, reading the Poke Ball as a representation of the technic of persona -- that which brings the wild creature within the scope of legality. The chapter moves away from the Pokemon trainer capturing nature through battles against wild Pokemon to the battles between trainers themselves. It turns from the structure of Pokemon as an analogy of law to the very nature of the game as a site of legality which, through its interactivity, reproduces an 'optical delusion' -- the anthropocentric gaze of law. This perspective points to the need for law to evolve beyond these delusions of anthropocentricity, embracing a change which may provide equity for the non-human creature.},

Given that Memory Studies is an ever expanding critical strategy, the approximately eighty contributors in this volume also discuss the potential for future research in this area. Topics covered range from texts to performance to visual and other aspects of material culture, all approached from within an interdisciplinary framework. International specialists, coming from such relevant fields as archaeology, mythology, history of religion, folklore, history, law, art, literature, philology, language, and mediality, offer assessments on the relevance of Memory Studies to their disciplines and show it at work in case studies. Finally, this handbook demonstrates the various levels of culture where memory had a critical impact in the pre-modern North and how deeply embedded the role of memory is in the material itself.},

The state of this discipline and the academic tensions in this field also indicate the ways in which academic community functions, as well as the mechanisms of their division or complication in the organizational and methodological plan. The ludological approach, which reduces the study of video games to the description and classification of rules and game mechanics, is regarded as reductionist, but also useful and applicable for understanding the specifics of video games. It is concluded that ludology, together with narratology and other academic disciplines in the field of humanities, forms a complete corpus of video game studies.},

The book includes chapters on Serbia, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Hungary, Estonia, Slovakia, Czechia, Finland, and (a Western guest with regional connections) Luxembourg. Through the lens of video games, the authors address how nations struggle with the legacies of war, colonialism, and religious strife that have been a part of nation-building - but also how victimized cultures can survive, resist, and sometimes prevail. Appealing primarily to scholars in the fields of game studies, heritage studies, postcolonial criticism, and media studies, this book will be particularly useful for the subfields of historical game studies and postcolonial game studies.},

We group the games in thematic-chronological categories: early medieval Slavic settings up to 1000, medieval to Renaissance Poland, and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1569--1795. Main findings: (a) Slavic fantasy became very popular with game developers after Witcher 3, but it has received little scholarly attention beside the witcher series. (b) Medieval Polish monarchies have barely caught the eye of game developers, which translates to the absence of related research. (c) The PLC period is well-represented in digital and nondigital games, and well-researched in historical games studies by Polish scholars in Polish and English.},

This article reviews four approaches to the study of public formation. These are (1) public and civic connections, (2) issue publics, (3) networked publics and (4) algorithmic publics. The review is a point of departure to conceptually discuss how to study the formation of public in a datafied era and to present a hybrid research agenda with four entry points that can open up for critical analysis of how datafication challenges the relationship between journalism, platforms, algorithms and audiences. Our argument is that a holistic, interdisciplinary and hybrid research approach is needed if the complexity of datafication and its transformative effects on the formation of publics is to be fully grasped.},

How does this change player experience, and how are these unrepeatable experiences different from the rest, in such a way that each may be treasured as something unique and irreplaceable? Throughout this thesis, I examine unrepeatable experiences in games, and the elements that characterize them. First, I summarize the current state of research regarding unrepeatability and other relevant topics. Next, I propose a framework through which to look at unrepeatable experiences, classifying them based on the extent of the content they affect, their effect on player experience, and the events that lead to their unrepeatability. Then, I apply this framework to many examples of unrepeatable experiences in games and play to show different ways in which unrepeatability can arise, whether intentional or unexpected. Finally, I point out some of the questions raised by the gaps in the framework, and highlight several possible avenues of further research that may prove useful in understanding what makes unrepeatability such a compelling and powerful phenomenon in play.},

While much work has been done to understand deceptive patterns of games and some unethical practices they apply, little is known about fake games, an emergent phenomenon in mobile gaming. To answer this question, we conducted two studies: a walkthrough method to characterize fake games, and a thematic analysis of user reviews to gain understanding from the user perspective. We found five types of misalignments that render a game fake and identified four primary facets of player experience with fake games. These misalignments act as realization points in the users' decision-making to define games as being fake. We discuss the fakeness of fake games, how the formation of an ecosystem helps with the circulation of fakeness, as well as challenges to governing fake games. Lastly, we propose implications for research and design on how to mitigate and identify fake games.},

Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) is a popular phenomenological approach combining richly detailed personal accounts with theory-driven interpretation to investigate lived experiences and contextualised meaning-making. Although it is applicable to a diverse range of experiences and has become a dominant qualitative approach in many disciplines, IPA has not been utilised as extensively in game studies. In this article, I outline IPA as a methodology with the potential to offer valuable insights for game studies. I draw on health research, where IPA is most prevalent, and a case study from my research comparing Campbell's hero's journey against player experiences in Breath of the Wild and Ocarina of Time to explain IPA's theoretical foundations, history, methods, strengths and weaknesses. I argue that IPA offers game studies a useful methodology for exploring the complexity, diversity, multiplicity and situatedness of practices and meanings around games.},

  abstract = {This doctoral dissertation critically investigates how the concept of metaphor is used with regard to games in game studies. The goal is to provide the field with a self-understanding of its metaphor discourse which has not been researched so far. The thesis departs from the observation that the notion of metaphor has been present in the discourse of game studies since it emerged as an academic field and focuses on questions such as: What are the motivations and effects of calling games metaphors in the game studies discourse? Which problems arise from that with regard to other established concepts in game studies such as simulation and procedural rhetoric? How do concepts and insights of contemporary metaphor theory affect the applicability of the notion of metaphor with regard to games? Drawing on concepts from metaphor theory (in particular the cognitive linguistic view on metaphor), play and game theory, cultural theory, semiotics, linguistics, philosophy, and game studies it investigates the metaphor discourse of game studies in the fashion of a meta-study. The main part of this thesis is devoted to three particular problems which have been derived from observations in the overview of the current use of the notion of metaphor in game studies. Firstly, this thesis investigates is the conceptual relationship between the notions of metaphor, representation, and play. It therefore accounts for observations such that all three notions are present in non-computer game and play theory, theory of representation and art which all influenced game studies and argues for an equiprimordial relation between these three concepts. Secondly, this thesis deals with what is termed the metaphor-simulation dilemma which accounts for the observation that in game studies the notion of metaphor is very often used in close conceptual proximity with the concept of simulation to the extent that they become conceptually indistinguishable. The two notions are reconciled through the notion of the model and a case study will demonstrate that it is possible to think of simulations as based on metaphorically structured models. Thirdly, thesis deals with the observation that the concept of metaphor is referred to in game studies in particular when games are interpreted in terms of some existential topic. Usually addressed from the perspective of (procedural) game rhetoric games are called metaphors for struggle, life, death, love. On the basis of a criticism of procedural rhetoric this thesis will suggest a distinction between a textual hermeneutic and an existential hermeneutic of games in which the latter is primary. It suggests furthermore that metaphoric interpretation of games is usually a sort of text interpretation. This supports the argument of a general de-metaphorization of alleged metaphoric computer games.},

Thirty leading scholars from Europe and America provide short, authoritative overviews of the state of knowledge and current controversies in the many specialist divisions in Homeric studies. The chapters pay equal attention to literary, mythological, linguistic, historical, and archaeological topics, ranging from such long-established problems as the "Homeric Question" to newer issues like the relevance of narratology and computer-assisted quantification. The collection, the third publication in Brill's handbook series, The Classical Tradition, will be valuable at every level of study - from the general student of literature to the Homeric specialist seeking a general understanding of the latest developments across the whole range of Homeric scholarship.},

This framing illustrates how the language and rhetorical strategies commonly employed to advocate for prosocial consent practices are often co-opted and mocked by those opposing so-called `woke' ideologies, highlighting deeper philosophical challenges in conceptualizing consent within game studies. Through a comprehensive literature review, this work traces the evolving understanding of consent in games, drawing on post-2016 election queer and feminist scholarship from a 2025 perspective. This analysis uncovers an ethos of care that addresses the dynamics of consent in play while framing consent as a nuanced, knowable and actionable concept. The editorial concludes by introducing the accompanying collection of essays, which build on this foundation to further advance the scholarly discourse on consent in games.},

Even articles that discuss the timeline logistics in earnest acknowledge how absurd the undertaking is (Jackson 2017). Nintendo developed each game without planning an inclusive timeline, yet this fervent fan speculation prompted Nintendo to release a ``definitive'' timeline in the 2011 collector's book Hyrule Historia (Aonuma et al.). The fact that the most recent release in the Zelda series -- 2017's Breath of the Wild -- has no evident place in these timelines draws renewed attention to their inadequacy. In light of this, I propose an alternative that offers a more organic bond than post-hoc timelines: regarding each game as a folkloric variant of one story, a fictional culture's rendition of the Hero's Journey.},

Starting from how GG gained popular attention, this article outlines and discusses the nature of GG, the relation to the victims, the sense of victimization among the participants, and how it may have been provoked by the long-standing, general disregard of games as a culture and a cultural artifact of value. It discusses GG as a swarm using this metaphor to describe its self-organizing nature. Further comparing GG to hooligans, this article also introduces a class and marginalization aspect to understanding the event, opening up for discourses that complicates the image of game culture as mainly a culture of isolated consumption.},

The campaign was especially successful at building online visibility through harassment, and the affective resonances of the issues it raised have since translated into general online campaigning how-to's, financial earnings, and even political action outside of the gaming sphere. Although the primary breeding ground for this movement was 4chan (and later, 8chan), it only reached public awareness and visibility -- hence, effectiveness -- through Twitter and, to a lesser extent, through YouTube. In order to understand the emotional charge and political relevance of this campaign, we rely on both quantitative and qualitative activity analyses of the Twitter users that use the hashtag \#GamerGate between 2014 and 2019. In addition to analyzing who were the most active tweeters and what kind of resonance their tweets elicited, we looked into the emotional qualities of their communication.},

The book delves into the commercial success of many controversial videogames: although such games may appear shocking for the observing bystander, playing them is experienced as deeply rewarding for the player. Drawing on qualitative player studies and approaches from media aesthetics theory, the book challenges the perception of games as innocent entertainment, and examines the range of emotional, moral, and intellectual experiences of players. As they explore what players consider transgressive, the authors ask whether there is something about the gameplay situation that works to mitigate the sense of transgression, stressing gameplay as an aesthetic experience. Anchoring the aesthetic game experience both in play studies as well as in aesthetic theory, this book will be an essential resource for scholars and students of game studies, aesthetics, media studies, philosophy of art, and emotions"--},

But the environmental emergency is also a crisis for our philosophical habits of thought, confronting us with a problem that seems to defy not only our control but also our understanding. Global warming is perhaps the most dramatic example of what Timothy Morton calls ``hyperobjects''---entities of such vast temporal and spatial dimensions that they defeat traditional ideas about what a thing is in the first place. In this book, Morton explains what hyperobjects are and their impact on how we think, how we coexist with one another and with nonhumans, and how we experience our politics, ethics, and art. Moving fluidly between philosophy, science, literature, visual and conceptual art, and popular culture, the book argues that hyperobjects show that the end of the world has already occurred in the sense that concepts such as world, nature, and even environment are no longer a meaningful horizon against which human events take place. Instead of inhabiting a world, we find ourselves inside a number of hyperobjects, such as climate, nuclear weapons, evolution, or relativity. Such objects put unbearable strains on our normal ways of reasoning. Insisting that we have to reinvent how we think to even begin to comprehend the world we now live in, Hyperobjects takes the first steps, outlining a genuinely postmodern ecological approach to thought and action.},

Accordingly, we propose a set of models to predict the probability of failure and success in different situations. This type of assessment can serve as a validation mechanism for automatic level generation algorithms and also to perform adaptive difficulty techniques. As a final point, we analyse multiple gameplay information retrieved from gaming sessions, in which 40 users performed over 10000 trials in different types of challenges. We have verified that the main hypotheses behind the proposed metrics are applicable and the estimators are valid approximations to the players' behaviour.},

In 1802, the geologist and philosopher of nature, Henrik Ste ens, returns to Copenhagen after spending seven years studying and researching in Jena. Back in Denmark, he holds a controversial and widely noted series of lectures that familiarize the Danish audience with the ideas of German Romanticism. The literary impact ascribed to Ste ens's lectures is at least equally as relevant as its philosophical content, as the young poet Adam Oehlenschl\"ager was a member of the audience. According to an anecdote in his autobiography, the creation of the rst programmatic poem of Scandinavian Romanticism was inspired by a sixteen-hour-long discussion with Ste ens. The anecdote of the poem's origin alone shows how Oehlenschl\"ager contributes to the self-referential staging and mythical aggrandisement of the epochal break into Romanticism which this chapter examines.},

  abstract = {Video games are becoming culturally dominant. But what does their popularity say about our contemporary society? This book explores video game culture, but in doing so, utilizes video games as a lens through which to understand contemporary social life. Video games are becoming an increasingly central part of our cultural lives, impacting on various aspects of everyday life such as our consumption, communities, and identity formation. Drawing on new and original empirical data -- including interviews with gamers, as well as key representatives from the video game industry, media, education, and cultural sector -- Video Games as Culture not only considers contemporary video game culture, but also explores how video games provide important insights into the modern nature of digital and participatory culture, patterns of consumption and identity formation, late modernity, and contemporary political rationalities. This book will appeal to undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers, interested in fields such Video Games, Sociology, and Media and Cultural Studies. It will also be useful for those interested in the wider role of culture, technology, and consumption in the transformation of society, identities, and communities.},

  abstract = {The infamous blood eagle ritual has long been controversial: did Viking Age Nordic people really torture one another to death by severing their ribs from their spine and removing their lungs, or is it all a misunderstanding of some complicated poetry? Previous scholarship on the topic has tended to focus on the details and reliability of extant medieval descriptions of the blood eagle, arguing for or against the ritual's historicity. What has not yet been considered are the anatomical and sociocultural limitations within which any Viking Age blood eagle would have had to have been performed. In this article, we analyze medieval descriptions of the ritual with modern anatomical knowledge, and contextualize these accounts with up-to-date archaeological and historical scholarship concerning elite culture and the ritualized peri- and post-mortem mutilation of the human body in the Viking Age. We argue that even the fullest form of the blood eagle outlined in our textual sources would have been possible, though difficult, to perform, but would have resulted in the victim's death early in proceedings. Given the context of the ritual depicted in medieval discourse, we also argue that any historical blood eagle would have existed as part of a wider continuum of cultural praxis, and been employed to secure the social status of the ritual's commissioner following the earlier ``bad death'' of a male relative at the hands of the ritual's victim.},

  abstract = {Digital games are an expanding popular cultural form and the focus of a new field of scholarship that has been concerned with defining games and establishing bound-aries between games and other phenomena. Studies of the coevolution of human cog-nition and culture can throw light on this discussion by putting gaming into a longer human perspective. Although 2 chief theorists of this field, Michael Tomasello and Merlin Donald, have not explicitly focused on games, their work has suggested that games could have played an important role in shaping the human mind and human culture, by expanding and preserving adaptive cultural patterns, furthering symbolic thinking, and expanding and preserving the expressiveness of symbolic media. Digi-tal games can be understood as carrying on the same functions, using the new affordances of the computer. As T.S. Eliot (1921) so famously remarked, "what happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which pre-ceded it." Marshall McLuhan (1994) noted the same effect in the invention of a new medium: It changes how we see the media that preceded it. The invention and strik-ing global popularity of the new genre of computer games within the new digital me-dium is having a similar effect, causing us to reconsider older cultural categories such as narrative, games, and play (Aarseth, 1997; Bolter \& Grusin, 1999; Laurel, 1993; Manovich, 2001; Murray, 1997). The rapid growth and enormous popularity of computer-based games has made them an object of study in their own right and provoked an active critical discourse about the relation of digital games to earlier media traditions and especially to narrative and film (Wardrip-Fruin \& Harrigan, 2004).},

Conversely, Coast Salish people invigorate new stories of the Wild Man as critique of the ruins of late capitalism. The Wild Man provides them with strength to assert their autonomy and authority in leading the restoration of the natural environment.

I argue that there is more at work here than a superficial re-skinning of characters and game space to suit national tastes and aesthetics and that Raji enters into much larger and ongoing debates about the function of representation. Through deep reading and critical analysis of Raji's characters and spaces, I provide a context for its role at the center of cultural and even political struggles. Ultimately, I show what representational stakes are revealed when a video game is overburdened with the responsibility of standing in for a whole culture, and why such interventions matter.},

The thesis is divided into three chapters which each interpret a different aspect of Skyrim gameplay in the context of their literary and historical antecedents. The first chapter looks at the connection between Anglo-Saxon mead halls and those found in Skyrim, particularly the socio-political role it plays both in literature and gameplay. The second chapter discusses the concept of the afterlife in Norse and Nordic culture, illustrating the similarities between the two religions and how their ideals ultimately impact player behavior throughout major quest lines. The third chapter focuses on dragons within Skyrim and their connection to the northern heroic image, ultimately demonstrating the important role they play both in Anglo-Saxon and Norse literature as well as Skyrim.},

This important role means that when ephemera survives, whether accidentally or deliberately, it does so despite itself. These survivals, because they evoke all those other objects that have necessarily been forgotten, can be described as uncanny. The paper is divided into three main sections. The first situates ephemera within an uncanny economy of memory and forgetting. The second focuses on ephemera at a particular historical moment, the industrialisation of print in the nineteenth century. This section considers the liminal place of newspapers and periodicals in this period, positioned as both provisional media for information as well as objects of record. The third section introduces a new configuration of technologies---scanners, computers, hard disks, monitors, the various connections between them---and considers the conditions under which born-digital ephemera can linger and return. Through this analysis, the paper concludes by considering digital technologies as an apparatus of memory, setting out what is required if we are not to be doubly haunted by the printed ephemera within the digital archive.},

In the course of this study, Myers asks a number of interesting questions: What are the mechanics of human play as exhibited in computer games? Can these mechanisms be modeled? What is the evolutionary function of cognitive play, and is it, on the whole, a good thing? Intended as a provocative corrective to the currently ascendant, if not dominant, cultural and ethnographic approach to game studies and play, Play Redux will generate interest among scholars of communications, new media, and film.},

Based in large part upon the sacred-space analysis of Dr. Tokutaro Sakurai  of Komazawa University, Tokyo (see in particular his Nihon minkan shink\^o ron [A Study  of  Japanese  Folk  Beliefs],  1958),  the  paper  explores  the  idea  of  spiritual hierophany  in  concentric  realms  of  space,  from  the  sacrality  of  the  nation,  to  the   community,  to  the  residence,  to  the  house,  and  to  the  person.    These  realms  of  sacrality  are  definitive  of  Shinto  and  emphasize  the  importance  of  the  distinction  between the pure "inner" and the impure "outer" in Japanese culture. It is the torii gate which marks the division between sacred and profane space,  and the paper explores the meaning and significance of the torii and other boundary-indicators  to  an  understanding  of  the  Japanese  identity.    In  particular,  I  argue  that  these  boundary-markers  are  indicative  of  the  peculiarly  Japanese  association  of  interiority and sacrality, and serve as "invisible barriers" to communication between Japanese  and  outsiders.    In  effect,  the  outside  world  is  "marked"  as  profane,  as  it  does not participate in the sacred quality of the heart, home, community, and nation.},

  abstract = {The post-apocalyptic game Horizon: Zero Dawn is a role-playing game that simulates the adventures of Aloy, a female protagonist, in a world where human civilization has returned to its premodern stage of development and the world's fauna has mysteriously become robotic. The cause for this regress into premodernity is revealed by the game's embedded narrative which explains that life on earth had almost become extinct as a result of a military AI going rogue. Implicit in the game's embedded narrative is a strong critique of global capitalism that highlights how neoliberal ideas such as corporate governance, deregulation, and automation imperil life on the planet. Despite its critique, gameplay is structured on the very principles that the game's narrative claims to reject. The world of Horizon: Zero Dawn simulates an entrepreneurial ecosystem in which the player must identify opportunities and manage resources in such a manner as to successfully beat the game. The in-game economy encourages the accumulation of natural resources and features no in-built mechanic to account for the environmental consequences of the playable character's actions, notwithstanding the environmental critique of the game's narrative. This article argues that, contrary to its scripted narrative, Horizon: Zero Dawn naturalizes capitalism by means of its procedural rhetoric. I further argue that the overt critique of capitalism diverts the player's attention from the capitalist principles that support gameplay, thus, paradoxically, consolidating the ideological nature of gameplay. The game's endorsement of capitalism dovetails with a meritocratic worldview which inflects the game's approach to cultural identity and diversity.},

  abstract = {A debate is currently raging regarding the value of anonymity online. On one side of the debate is Facebook, the world's largest social network site. Facebook demands that people use their real names and is one of the leading forces behind the push towards a ``real name'' Internet. On the other side of the debate are scholars such as danah boyd and Bernie Hogan and sites such as 4chan and Reddit that view anonymity and pseudonymity as important to how people construct identity online. While much has been written about the benefits of anonymity and pseudonymity, there is a lack of published research examining specific practices enabled by pseudonyms. This paper provides a detailed account of the behaviors enabled through pseudonymous identity construction through a case study of the subreddit r/gonewild. The main contribution of the article is to provide a specific account of the costs of a totalizing embrace of the ``real name'' Internet.},

The feminist side of the online culture wars has its equally geeky subcultures right through to its mainstream expression.

The unique framework of the Frankenstein myth has permeated the public discourse about science and knowledge, creating various misconceptions around and negative expectations for scientists and for scientific enterprises more generally. Using the Frankenstein myth as an imaginative tool, we interviewed twelve scientists to explore how this science narrative shapes their views and perceptions of science. Our results yielded two main conclusions. First, the Frankenstein myth may help scientists identify popular concerns about their work and offer a framework for constructing a more positive narrative. Second, finding optimistic science narratives may allow scientists to build a better relationship with the public. We argue that by showing the ethical principles and social dimensions of their work, scientists could replace a negative Frankenstein narrative with a more optimistic one.},

Following in the footsteps of the brilliant yet troubled Victor Frankenstein, professionals and practitioners have been debating the scientific ethics of creating life for decades, never before have powerful tools for doing so been so widely available. This paper investigates how engaging with the Frankenstein myth may help scientists gain a more accurate understanding of their own beliefs and opinions about the social and ethical aspects of their profession and their work. The paper presents findings from phenomenological interviews with twelve scientists working on biotechnology, robotics, or artificial intelligence projects. The results suggest that the Frankenstein myth, and the figure of Victor Frankenstein in particular, establishes norms for scientists about what is considered unethical and dangerous in scientific work. The Frankenstein myth both serves as a social and ethical reference for scientists and a mediator between scientists and the society. Grappling with the cultural ubiquity of the Frankenstein myth prepares scientists to face their ethical dilemmas and create a more transparent research agenda. Meanwhile, by focusing on the differences between real scientists and the imaginary figure of Victor Frankenstein, scientists may avoid being labeled as dangerous individuals, and could better conceptualize the potential societal and ethical perceptions and implications of their research.},

It has become a myth reflecting people's ambivalent feelings about emerging science: they are curious about science, but they are also afraid of what science can do to them. In this essay, we argue that the Frankenstein myth has evolved into a stigma attached to scientists that focalizes the public's as well as the scientific community's negative reactions towards certain sciences and scientific practices. This stigma produces ambivalent reactions towards scientific artifacts and it leads to negative connotations because it implies that some sciences are dangerous and harmful. We argue that understanding the Frankenstein stigma can empower scientists by helping them revisit their own biases as well as responding effectively to people's expectations for, and attitudes towards, scientists and scientific artifacts. Debunking the Frankenstein stigma could also allow scientists to reshape their professional identities so they can better show the public what ethical and moral values guide their research enterprises.},

  abstract = {Released in 2019, the video game Death Stranding follows the monomythic structure described by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. The journey begins with the protagonist, Sam ``Porter'' Bridges, reluctantly accepting his calls to adventure, and, as he begins to move west, he receives supernatural aid from an increasing number of helpers he encounters along the way. Crossing the thresh-old, into the world of danger and adventure, has him meeting the threshold guardian Higgs, the primary antagonist of the game. During this first stage, the player of the game learns how to control Sam's movements and how to navigate this world to-gether with the Bridge Baby known as Lou, who helps Sam on his journey. The second stage of the journey has Sam moving through a road of trials, overcoming both the physical obstacles of the terrain and the emotional obstacles of the people he helps along the way. He is at one point tempted to adopt the Bridge Baby Lou, his primary helper, but resists said temptation and continues on his jour-ney, until he is finally reunited with his sister, Amelie, who is threatening to end hu-manity in an extinction event. The lessons he has learnt on his journey -- to focus on helping others and only using violence when the situation calls for it -- leads him to his apotheosis, which is the realization of the value of other people and the relation-ships between them. With this realization, and Sam's physical manifestation of it in his embracing of Amelie, convinces her that humanity deserves to live to die another day, and so the world is saved from falling into ruin. The third stage of Sam's journey has him struggling to return home, aided at long last by the help of the friends he made on his journey. Sam, however, is uninter-ested in the world he helped save, and aims to return to his life of solitude. Upon his atonement with his father, however, he resolves this internal conflict and he is now free to live life as he wishes -- as a father to the now freed baby Lou. The use of game mechanics in Death Stranding ultimately provides the player with alternatives to violence, giving way to a narrative that can contain as-pects of the monomythic hero that are not exclusively related to the typical warrior hero seen in most action games. Instead, the game frames the tools of the warrior as the stepping-stone to the hero as lover, who uses more peaceful means to achieve their goals. This exemplifies the potential of the video game medium as a platform for the monomyth, and how games could come to encompass a wider variety of he-roic figures than those currently available.},

  abstract = {The project ``Myth and ideology in contemporary video games (LUDOMYTHOLOGIES)'', funded by the Spanish government and currently in its first year, analyses myths, mythemes, and mythical structures in games from a double perspective: as an update of a transcendent cultural heritage and as a mythical fabric shaped by ludic rituals and common affordances. The recurrent nature of myths establishes, through transcendent and immanent structures, old and new, a cultural space where our societies negotiate their fears, aspirations, and concerns. The main hypothesis of the project is that myths, both from a transcendent perspective (myths in the present) and from an immanent one (myths of the present), have in games a space for ideological and narrative development that helps in understanding contemporary society. We aim to show not only the validity of myths even in the most contemporary forms of culture, but also the constant creation of new mythical structures to make meaning from the world. To do so, our project uses mythanalysis as its main methodological tool, placing our view of games firmly in the Humanities. In this presentation, we aim to explore and unpack the specificities and affordances of this methodology of analysis. The continuity of cultural traditions throughout the centuries found one of its main vehicles in stories. Motifs, symbols, and structures tend to coincide in the history of different civilizations throughout time, generating a tendency towards cultural sedimentation that helps explain the origins of the world, the meaning of being human, and eschatological speculation. Myths can be understood as stories about the exploits of supernatural beings (Eliade, 1999, pp. 13-14) transmitted through tradition and ritual (Ker\'enyi and Jung, 2004, p.17), but also as "any story that can transcend, be repeated, give rise to new stories, or even be the origin of new myths." (Mart\'inez Garc\'ia, 2017, p. 29). For Karen Armstrong, the power of myths lies in their recurrence: a myth is ``an event which, in some sense, had happened once, but which also happened all the time'' (2005). Myths are then not closed things but cultural processes of meaning-making (Fern\'andez D\'iaz, 1996) where the historical repetition reaches us like an echo from the past. We consider both myths in the present and myths of the present. The first would be reinterpretation of existing myths in games, where the great myths of the past reverberate in modern texts through a process of repetition (Bolter and Grusin, 1999) where myths close the circle that begins with archetypes, continues with themes, and are singled out in symbols EXTENDED ABSTRACT - 9 - (Losada, 2010). The myths of the present establish the immanence of the foundational fact, the social, political and cultural bond that is conceived in reality as a new mythical genesis. From this perspective, myths can not only transit and mutate between historical periods but can also be born out of a specific context. This was the contribution that Barthes (1999) made when considering myth as an indeterminate and changing infinity of social representations based on a relationship of deformation. Within our field, games have been linked to mythopoeia or myth-making (Cirilla, Rone, 2020; Cragoe, 2015), to regenerative play through mythical structures (Farca, Lehner, and Navarro, 2020), and to repetitions of existing myths within new settings (Yoon, 2021), and described as ``contemporary mythology'' (Asimos, 2019). From the perspective of myths in the present, the few approaches that have been made from Game Studies have done so through the analysis of games whose theme is literally mythological (Cassar, 2013), so there is little research specifically focused on the mythical character of games. There are brief approaches to analogue games (Garc\'ia and Del Canto Nieto, 2019), to the context of production in the conformation of myths, or to the generation of new mythical worlds from previous elements (Guyker, 2016; Galanina and Salin, 2016; Galanina and Baturin, 2020). From the perspective of the myths of the present, we see how the repeated use of motifs from our time, such as recurring actions and motivations, ends up creating a structural substrate with potential of a mythical nature. Contemporary games recurrently incorporate the fears and concerns of our time. The climate crisis, pandemics, refugees, citizenship, populism and totalitarianism, disability, the place of minorities, technological solutionism, or the collapse of socioeconomic structures are themes found in games from The Last of Us to Bury Me, My Love. This representation of pressing issues is sometimes only cosmetic, but it is often built upon repeated patterns of play and design, archetypical mechanics, minimal game units, and storytelling. Structuralist and culturalist approaches, even with their notable differences, allow myths to be perceived as a system of relations, an articulated combination of different elements that end up forming both a structure of meaning and a field of discussion between social and cultural agents. Mythanalysis allows us to study that structural and cultural dimension of games. It is a methodological process proposed by figurative structuralism (Guti\'errez, 2012, p. 181) and, more specifically, by Gilbert Durand (1982). Whereas myth-criticism seeks to study the work through its mythemes (or minimal units of meaning in myths, according to L\'evi-Strauss, 2009) and "mythical settings'' (Durand, 1982), mythanalysis seeks to discover "the patent or latent myths that go through, 'work', or sustain a certain cultural moment" (Guti\'errez , 2012, p. 183). Mythanalysis looks for the (explicit and/or latent) connections between the myths and the era to which that product belongs, in order to offer a sociological and cultural interpretation that goes beyond the object of study itself (Planells, 2021). Mythanalysis is not close reading and, as a methodological tool, allows us to carry out a study of myths in games in its aforementioned double nature, in and of the present. We will focus our presentation on how we understand and apply mythanalysis in our project. Using this methodology, we analyse themes in games considering all game elements (Zubek, - 10 - 2020), from fiction to mechanics, dynamics, experience and loops. Game and fiction structures can have recurrences and be interwoven through these recurrences and contribute to meaning-making. The data we gather includes these structures and recurrences but also information on the contexts of production and reception and analysis of implied players (Aarseth, 2007). Close readings and comparative analysis are the main touchstones of this project, focused on managing mythemes and mythical structures We plan to play a corpus of games ourselves, and each game will be preferably played by different members of the project and compared with available online playthroughs, to gather as much information as possible on dynamics/gameplay and aesthetic experiences. Game selection is based on a double thematic filter: straight adaptations of myths and relevance to a set of contemporary social issues; and also on a two-phase approach, with a first phase based on a pre-understanding of these themes and a second one where the key criteria of the corpus have been set. We aim to cover the aspects of each game that contribute to their thematic construction. We look for recurrences, mythemes, and tensions with issues of the present expressed through classical or new structures. For this, we combine a myth-to-game approach (identifying pre-existing myths or specific associations of mythemes) with a game-to-myth one (identifying new mythical structures). Especially for the second part, we include contemporary perspectives such as postcolonial theory. We will consider we have arrived at a sound analysis of the data when these old and new structures have been identified in the games we pre-select and compared among the corpus, when we have identified recurrences that deal with tensions of contemporaneity. In this presentation, we will briefly discuss two examples with a myth in the present, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice (Ninja Theory, 2017), and a myth of the present, Distraint and Distraint 2 (Jesse Makkonen, 2015; 2018). We aim to show mythanalysis as a valid tool for the ludofictional and thematic analysis of games, a methodology that, when combined with other tools of the field, allows to conduct comprehensive studies of mechanics, rules, dynamics, fictional components, aesthetics and other game elements that contribute to complex processes of meaning-making that are never closed but exist in tension, recurring among a single game and a shared cultural space, a set of game loops that have happened before but also happened all the time.},

  abstract = {The popularity and influence enjoyed by Japanese video games is irrefutable. There is little doubt, for many scholars, that the Japanese video game industry has helped establish the standard procedures of production, distribution and localization for the global sector. However, beyond titles of overwhelming international repercussion---from Space Invaders (Taito, 1978) to Silent Hills (2015), without forgetting Super Mario Bros. (Nintendo, 1985)---very little has been published on the production of Japanese video games destined for the domestic market, where genres unpopular in the West, such as visual novels or dating sims, are the staples. This leads us to consider the effectiveness and necessity of the term g\^emu (Picard, 2013) as a separate category for the critique of Japanese video games. In this paper, we start with Picard's contribution, which defined the socio-economic variables of g\^emus, and set out to explore their design and aesthetic features in the broad context of Japanese entertainment products. To do so, we try to delimit the role that g\^emu have played in the expansion of Cool Japan and the synergies between them, manga and anime within the Japanese media mix. This allows us to describe a list of particular aesthetic and creative features of g\^emu; a set of characteristics which, although not universal, can be usefully applied in game criticism to provide a better understanding of the particular features of g\^emu.},

Contributors will examine a range of FPS games such as the Doom, Half-Life, System Shock, Deus Ex, Halo, Medal of Honor and Call of Duty franchises. By applying and enriching a broad range of perspectives, this volume will address the cultural relevance and place of the genre in game studies, game theory and the cultures of game players. Guns, Grenades, and Grunts gathers scholars from all disciplines to bring the weight of contemporary social theory and media criticism to bear on the public controversy and intellectual investigation of first-person shooter games. As a genre, FPS games have helped shepherd the game industry from the early days of shareware distribution and underground gaming clans to contemporary multimillion dollar production budgets, Hollywood-style launches, downloadable content and worldwide professional gaming leagues. The FPS has been and will continue to be a staple of the game market.},

  abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries implemented social distancing measures to contain virus transmission. However, these vital safety measures have the potential to impair mental health or wellbeing, for instance, from increased perceived loneliness. Playing social video games may offer a way to continue to socialize while adhering to social distancing measures. To examine this issue further, the present online survey investigated social gaming during the pandemic and its association to perceived loneliness within a German-speaking sample. Results indicated a small positive correlation between general gaming frequency and perceived loneliness. Detailed analysis revealed a negative association between perceived loneliness and increased social forms of video gaming. Specifically, gamers with a higher social motive for gaming perceived less loneliness, but gamers with a dominant escape motive demonstrated a positive link to perceived loneliness. The use of social gaming in times of social distancing seems to play a small but significant factor in perceived loneliness compared to other demographical data. The findings are discussed with respect to methodological limitations, effect sizes, and sample characteristics. The results enrich the current knowledge on video gaming and its link to social wellbeing and provide a more nuanced picture than simplistic investigations of screen time.},

Retro-game scholarship has considered 8 and 16-bit titles and fan practices through the concept of nostalgia since the mid-2000s. However, increasingly AAA game publishers have begun to remake and remaster more recent games. Given the potential for nostalgia to be either an oppressive or resistive set of interactions between object-game and subject-player, this paper analyses how restorative and reflective nostalgia is manifested throughout the narrative and gameplay mechanics of Yakuza Kiwami and Final Fantasy VII Remake, alongside players' and digital game journalists reactions to the titles. This study utilizes a qualitative analysis of the remade titles, user comments from the E3 trailers posted to YouTube for each game, and digital game popular press articles to approach nostalgic reactions. Ultimately, the potential for both modes of nostalgia coexist as each of these titles are consumed and exist alongside other consumer goods.},

In order to do this, we have analyzed one of the hundreds of fairy tales present in the work of the Russian writer and linguist Aleksandr Nikolaevi\v c Afanas'ev, Narodnye russkie skazki, an extraordinary collection and classification of a large amount of fairy tales of the Slavic oral culture. Our analysis focuses on the well-known character Baba Jaga, the `wooden leg' witch, who lives in an izbaand rests on hen's legs in an enchanted wood. In particular, an attempt is made to conduct a translatological analysis of Afanas'ev's text, within the framework of textual typology considering the translation macro-strategy, the most significant linguistic factors, as well assome potential translation strategies which help the story to fit in the target language and culture in the best possible way.},

This paper describes the most important elements of the narrative as well as some innovative features of the videogame, which enables players to craft artistic objects (by oneself or in cooperation with other players) and to share them with other players online. We suggest that anxieties and conflicts of our era have been unconsciously represented in the Halo titles. Their narratives deal with the risk of extinction of humankind for both outer and inner disasters including the invasion by alien species from space, or self-destruction due to perverse use of scientific and technological progress. Therefore, playing the game (which involves both shooting at enemies and creating personal works-of-art) might have therapeutic functions, allowing the players to ``work through'' collective unconscious anxieties. This could explain the extraordinary success of the Halo brand and open new horizons in the development of future videogames. Potentially addictive (negative) aspects of the videogame are also considered.},

By means of playful critical interaction design methods, we explore how deviance from the ritual of mediated interaction through taking pictures on the mobile phone may enhance our understanding of artificial agents. Building upon Ling's work, we mobilize the ritual aspect of mobile communication to open possibilities for imagining alternatives of seeing the world through artificial intelligence. We conclude by arguing that playful designs in mobile communication research may allow us to disassemble and reassemble mobile apps which enables critical reflection on the role of artificial agents in mobile rituals.},

  abstract = {Calls for climate justice abound as evidence accumulates of the growing social and environmental injustices aggravated or driven by climate change. There is now a considerable and diverse literature on procedural, distributional and intergenerational dimensions, including questions of recognition in climate justice. Yet its meaning, scope and practical implications are still contested. Importantly, the broader landscape within which climate justice is situated is rapidly changing, bringing new challenges to the understanding and practice of climate justice. This review takes stock of climate justice literature in view of this new context. We find several disconnects and tensions between more philosophical and academic treatments of the subject on the one hand, and ``activist''-oriented approaches to climate justice on the other. Scholarship often falls into silos around scales from global and local, between mitigation and adaptation or draws distinctions between climate justice and other forms of (in)justice. This inhibits an understanding of climate justice that can address more directly its underlying root causes in an historically constituted global economic system and intersecting set of social inequalities. We propose a research agenda centered on a transformative approach to climate justice, placing analysis of power in its various guises at the center of its enquiry, and subverting and moving beyond existing distinctions by focusing on the social and institutional relations and inequalities that both produce climate change and profoundly shape responses to it. We elaborate on three key strands of such an approach: inclusive climate justice, deepening climate justice and governance for climate justice.},

We examine Reddit during a period of community unrest affecting millions of users in the summer of 2015, and analyze large-scale changes in user behavior and migration patterns to Reddit-like alternative platforms. Using self-reported statements from user comments, surveys, and a computational analysis of the activity of users with accounts on multiple platforms, we identify the primary motivations driving user migration. While a notable number of Reddit users left for other platforms, we found that an important pull factor that enabled Reddit to retain users was its long tail of niche content. Other platforms may reach critical mass to support popular or ``mainstream'' topics, but Reddit's large userbase provides a key advantage in supporting niche topics.},

  abstract = {The cultural contradictions of early video games: a medium for family fun (but mainly for middle-class boys), an improvement over pinball and television (but possibly harmful) Beginning with the release of the Magnavox Odyssey and Pong in 1972, video games, whether played in arcades and taverns or in family rec rooms, became part of popular culture, like television. In fact, video games were sometimes seen as an improvement on television because they spurred participation rather than passivity. These ``space-age pinball machines'' gave coin-operated games a high-tech and more respectable profile. In Atari Age, Michael Newman charts the emergence of video games in America from ball-and-paddle games to hits like Space Invaders and Pac-Man, describing their relationship to other amusements and technologies and showing how they came to be identified with the middle class, youth, and masculinity. Newman shows that the ``new media'' of video games were understood in varied, even contradictory ways. They were family fun (but mainly for boys), better than television (but possibly harmful), and educational (but a waste of computer time). Drawing on a range of sources---including the games and their packaging; coverage in the popular, trade, and fan press; social science research of the time; advertising and store catalogs; and representations in movies and television---Newman describes the series of cultural contradictions through which the identity of the emerging medium worked itself out. Would video games embody middle-class respectability or suffer from the arcade's unsavory reputation? Would they foster family togetherness or allow boys to escape from domesticity? Would they make the new home computer a tool for education or just a glorified toy? Then, as now, many worried about the impact of video games on players, while others celebrated video games for familiarizing kids with technology essential for the information age.},

  abstract = {The problem for curators and archivists of digital games is that the games are inherently unstable. As a range of commentators have explored, gameplay in digital games often takes quite unexpected, unpredictable and emergent directions as players probe at the boundaries of rules and systems. For those engaged in the archiving, curation and exhibition of digital games, a clear challenge comes from the contingency of playing preferences, and that various `playings' might be differently informed by prefigurative and regulatory materials such as walkthroughs, FAQs and reviews. However, before we get to considerations of the ways it is (re)configured through the performance of play, in fact regardless of whether it is ever played at all, we should recognise that a digital game is a potentially changing, unstable object. In fact, it is typically better thought of as a growing and mutating collection of many objects. This article centres less on ideas of performance or the changing nature of the game at play but rather concentrates on the instability of the fabric of the game to-be-played-with. As media that are routinely ported (transferred and translated) to different operating systems and platforms with differing hardware and software capabilities, and patched (updated to fix bugs or modify gameplay mechanics), digital games simply cannot be conceived of as static objects or texts. To demonstrate the impact of porting and patching on the instability of digital games, this article draws on an analysis of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series.},

  abstract = {This dissertation asserts that the internet and widespread digital media have provided a place for storytelling that was not present in the age where television was the dominant provider of narrative, and that the type of storytelling that happens in that place recalls oral traditional, not mass media, models. By looking at three qualities of traditional storytelling--variability, performance, and collectivity--I demonstrate that the relationship between author, text, and audience is becoming more fluid and dynamic. I suggest that, considering these shifts toward modes that recall traditional storytelling, the best perspective from which to view these changes is that provided by folklore studies, as it provides a holistic framework for examining the teller, the story, the audience, the ways they influence each other in the act of telling, and the formation of communities around stories over time.},

  abstract = {Abstract             There seems to be a deep tension between two aspects of aesthetic appreciation. On the one hand, we care about getting things right. Our attempts at aesthetic judgments aim at correctness. On the other hand, we demand autonomy. We want appreciators to arrive at their aesthetic judgments through their own cognitive efforts, rather than through deferring to experts. These two demands seem to be in tension; after all, if we want to get the right judgments, we should defer to the judgments of experts. How can we resolve this tension? The best explanation, I suggest, is that aesthetic appreciation is something like a game. When we play a game, we try to win. But often, winning isn't the point; playing is. Aesthetic appreciation involves the same flipped motivational structure: we aim at the goal of correctness, but having correct judgments isn't the point. The point is the engaged process of interpreting, investigating, and exploring the aesthetic object. When one defers to aesthetic testimony, then, one makes the same mistake as when one looks up the answer to a puzzle, rather than solving it for oneself. The shortcut defeats the whole point. This suggests a new account of aesthetic value: the engagement account. The primary value of the activity of aesthetic appreciation lies in the process of trying to generate correct judgments, and not in having correct judgments.},

  abstract = {"Games are a unique art form. The game designer doesn't just create a world; they create who you will be in that world. They tell you what abilities to use and what goals to take on. In other words, they specify a form of agency. Games work in the medium of agency. And to play them, we take on alternate agencies and submerge ourselves in them. What can we learn about our own rationality and agency, from thinking about games? We learn that we have a considerable degree of fluidity with our agency. First, we have the capacity for a peculiar sort of motivational inversion. For some of us, winning is not the point. We take on an interest in winning temporarily, so that we can play the game. Thus, we are capable of taking on temporary and disposable ends. We can submerge ourselves in alternate agencies, letting them dominate our consciousness, and then dropping them the moment the game is over. Games are, then, a way of recording forms of agency, of encoding them in artifacts. Our games are a library of agencies. And exploring that library can help us develop our own agency and autonomy. But this technology can also be used for art. Games can sculpt our practical activity, for the sake of the beauty of our own actions. Games are part of a crucial, but overlooked category of art - the process arts. These are the arts which evoke an activity, and then ask you to appreciate your own activity. And games are a special place where we can foster beautiful experiences of our own activity. Because our struggles, in games, can be designed to fit our capacities. Games can present a harmonious world, where our abilities fit the task, and where we pursue obvious goals and act under clear values. Games are a kind of existential balm against the difficult and exhausting value clarity of the world. But this presents a special danger. Games can be a fantasy of value clarity. And when that fantasy leaks out into the world, we can be tempted to oversimplify our enduring values. Then, the pleasures of games can seduce us away from our autonomy, and reduce our agency."--},

Game designers designate goals and abilities for the player; they shape the agential skeleton which the player will inhabit during the game. Game designers work in the medium of agency. Game-playing, then, illuminates a distinctive human capacity. We can take on ends temporarily for the sake of the experience of pursuing them. Game play shows that our agency is significantly more modular and more fluid than we might have thought. It also demonstrates our capacity to take on an inverted motivational structure.

Whilst this is helpful to address historical inconsistencies and the often-resulting lack of critical perspective on warfare in general, it is perhaps more accurate to refer to Call of Duty as a site of memory. Call of Duty is not interested in an accurate historical retelling of war, rather, it is to evoke cultural memories usually produced by (popular) media related to specific events, repurposing them for entertainment. By analysing Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War through its Vietnam War missions, I explore the formal and narrative qualities of the game to examine what the game chooses to remember. Two key aspects can be found in its gameplay: the game takes on an exclusive U.S.-American perspective on the Vietnam War. Second, Vietnamese characters are largely absent or only exist as enemies. I will then discuss the game's use of the Vietnam War as a catharsis for its storytelling and how it fails to live up to any subversive potential it has concerning its treatment of memory. This essay will then conclude with final thoughts on how the Vietnam War is remembered in international politics and how its remembrance is also related to intergenerational divides within the Vietnamese diaspora.},

Some have argued that, when we insist that players obey the rules of a game, we give too much weight to the author's intent. Others have argued that such obedience to the rules violates the true purpose of games, which is fostering free and creative play. Both of these responses, I argue, misunderstand the nature of games and their rules. The rules do not tell us how to interpret a game; they merely tell us what the game is. And the point of the rules is not always to foster free and creative play. The point can be, instead, to communicate a sculpted form of activity. And in games, as with any form of communication, we need some shared norms to ground communicative stability. Games have what has been called a ``prescriptive ontology.'' A game is something more than simply a piece of material. It is some material as approached in a certain specified way. These prescriptions help to fix a common object of attention. Games share this prescriptive ontology with more traditional kinds of works. Novels are more than just a set of words on a page; they are those words read in a certain order. Games are more than just some software or cardboard bits; they are those bits interacted with according to certain rules. Part of a game's essential nature is the prescriptions for how we are to play it. What's more, we investigate the prescriptive ontology of games, we will uncover at least distinct prescriptive categories of games. Party games prescribe that we encounter the game once; heavy strategy games prescribe we encounter the game many times; and community evolution games prescribe that we encounter the game while embedded in an ongoing community of play.},

And we use that feeling, in the rough-and-tumble of daily life, as a signal that we have investigated a matter sufficiently. The sense of clarity functions as a               thought-terminating heuristic               . In that case, our use of clarity creates significant cognitive vulnerability, which hostile forces can try to exploit. If an epistemic manipulator can imbue a belief system with an exaggerated sense of clarity, then they can induce us to terminate our inquiries too early -- before we spot the flaws in the system. How might the sense of clarity be faked? Let's first consider the object of imitation: genuine understanding. Genuine understanding grants cognitive facility. When we understand something, we categorize its aspects more easily; we see more connections between its disparate elements; we can generate new explanations; and we can communicate our understanding. In order to encourage us to accept a system of thought, then, an epistemic manipulator will want the system to provide its users with an exaggerated sensation of cognitive facility. The system should provide its users with the feeling that they can easily and powerfully create categorizations, generate explanations, and communicate their understanding. And manipulators have a significant advantage in imbuing their systems with a pleasurable sense of clarity, since they are freed from the burdens of accuracy and reliability. I offer two case studies of seductively clear systems: conspiracy theories; and the standardized, quantified value systems of bureaucracies.},

Examples include becoming motivated by FitBit's step counts, Twitter Likes and Retweets, citation rates, ranked lists of best schools, and Grade Point Averages. We are vulnerable to value capture because of the competitive advantage that such crisp and clear expressions of value have in our private reasoning and our public justification. But value capture poses several threats. First, value capture threatens to change the goals of our activities, in a way that often threatens to undermine the value of those activities. Twitter's scoring system threatens to replace some of the richer goals of communication --- understanding, connection, and the mutual pursuit of truth --- with the thinner goals of getting likes and going viral. Second, in value capture, we take a core process of our autonomy and self-governance --- our ongoing deliberation over the exact articulation of our values --- and we outsource it. That outsourcing cuts off one of the key benefits to self-governing deliberation. In value capture, we no longer adjust our values and their articulations in light of own rich particular and context-sensitive experience of the world. Our values should be carefully tailored to our particular selves and particular communities, but in value capture, we buy our values off the rack.},

Coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the release of the film, Rayna Denison curates this new collection to critically reflect on Princess Mononoke's significance within and beyond Japanese culture. The collection investigates the production, and re-production, processes involved in the making ofPrincess Mononoke into a global phenomenon and reevaluates the film's significance within a range of global markets, animation techniques, and cultures. In revisiting this undeniably important film, the collection sheds light on the tensions within anime and the cultural and social issues that Princess Mononoke explores, from environmental protection to globalization to the representation of marginalized groups. In this remarkable new collection, Princess Mononoke is examined as a key player during a major turning point in Japanese animation history.},

  abstract = {Game engines are code frameworks, software toolsets, and proprietary structures that enable videogame content to be produced and published on a variety of platforms. They tend to manage low-level computational routines such as rendering, physics, and artificial intelligence, thereby allowing game designers, artists, and programmers to streamline their development practices. It used to be that videogame companies would develop their own proprietary engines to optimize in-house development practices. Occasionally, companies would also license their engines to other companies, or make their toolsets freely available to modding communities. Since the mid-2000s, however, a small handful of third-party engines such as Unreal and Unity have come to monopolise videogame production across both professional and amateur contexts. These third-party engines tend to work on subscription-based models or, in the case of Unity, free-to-use (and rather opaque) platform-based models designed to monopolise network effects (see Srnicek, 2016). This paper offers insight into the state of game engines today -- that is, how game engines are being used and implemented in a variety of institutional settings and design practices -- by drawing on interviews with Australian game designers (both professional and amateur) as well as tertiary game design students and educators. Interviews for this project are currently underway, though we have so far conducted 15 of approximately 17 planned interviews. The interviews are semi-structured, and typically last between 45--- 60 minutes. Participants are asked a range of questions about their thoughts and opinions on game engines, such as how differently engines influence the way they approach, learn about, or teach the process of game design. The interviews are then transcribed and thematically analysed through a process that involves coding the data based on common themes, responses, and concerns. We chose to interview Australian participants only so as to make geographically specific claims about the use of game engines in Australian contexts.},

For scholars of media production, software culture, and platform studies, this book provides a framework and language to better articulate the increasingly dominant role of software tools in cultural production. For videogame developers, educators, and students, it provides critical and historical grounding for a tool that is widely used yet rarely analysed from a cultural angle.},

Focusing on the production of news and games, the analysis shows that in economic terms platformization entails the replacement of two-sided market structures with complex multisided platform configurations, dominated by big platform corporations. Cultural content producers have to continuously grapple with seemingly serendipitous changes in platform governance, ranging from content curation to pricing strategies. Simultaneously, these producers are enticed by new platform services and infrastructural changes. In the process, cultural commodities become fundamentally ?contingent,? that is increasingly modular in design and continuously reworked and repackaged, informed by datafied user feedback.},

We argue that the term ``loot box'' and the phenomena it covers are not sufficiently precise for academic use and instead introduce the notion of ``random reward mechanisms'' (RRMs). We offer a categorization of RRMs, which distinguishes between RRMs that are either ``isolated'' from real world economies or ``embedded'' in them. This distinction will be useful in discussion about loot boxes in general, but specifically when it comes to the question of whether or not they represent instances of gambling. We argue that all classes of RRMs have gambling-like features, but that only one class can be considered to be genuine gambling.},

Chapter One gives a short introduction to the history of the word "addiction" and describes how gambling disorder (the only officially recognized behavioral addiction) came to be defined as an addiction. Chapter 2 will take a look at the negative consequences of video game play that are most commonly cited in the literature on game addiction. This review will show how researchers' claims of negative effects caused by video game playing are wildly exaggerated. Chapter 3 adds a short review of what is sometimes cited as historical precursors to Internet gaming disorder and argue that these are, in fact, not examples of addictions. Chapter 4 will analyze the diagnostic criteria that make up "Internet Gaming Disorder" and provide some theoretical concerns about their validity. Chapter 5 is a qualitative study of the experiences and opinions of a small group of players who might wrongly be labeled as "video game addicts." Chapter 6 is a case study of the unfortunate outcomes that may arise when anxiety is misdiagnosed as "video game addiction." Chapter 7 reviews the argument that video games are addictive due to the neurochemical effects they produce in the brain. Chapter 8 draws on anthropological psychiatry and discusses the different cultural contexts in which "video game addiction" exists. The chapter highlights potential problems that arise when psychiatric disorders are transferred across cultures. The dissertation concludes that there is insufficient scientific evidence to support the notion that "Internet gaming disorder" is an addictive disorder.},

Many parents are concerned by reports in the popular press about the concept of video game addiction. This chapter aims to critically examine some of the most prolific concerns surrounding the concept of video game addiction and provide a discussion of the science behind such concerns. Among the concerns discussed in this chapter are (1) the idea that increasing amount of time spent playing is a symptom of addiction, (2) the notion that video games are forms of digital substances akin to cocaine or heroin, (3) the concern that Internet descriptions of symptoms can be used for diagnostic purposes, and 4) the concern that video games necessarily have negative consequences. We argue that the term ``addiction'' is not well suited to describe children's involvement with digital media.},

Cultural, categorical pairings of concepts---and the classificatory systems that they are part of---are embedded in and evoked by the features of our environment. Accordingly, the ways we define and use space are rife with the possibility of boundary play, that is, the visible, imaginative manipulation of shared cultural-cognitive categories for the purpose of amusement. The discussion focuses on three analytical opportunities: (a) children playing in and around a cagelike dog crate, (b) the design solutions found in the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas's McCormick Tribune Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and (c) an interactive design project called Tableportation by Giorgio Olivero and Peggy Thoeny. These examples each reflect and encourage our explorations of classificatory boundaries. In the process, they reveal this particular kind of play as well as the worldview that lies behind it.},

Princess Mononoke was also the first of Studio Ghibli's films to be distributed outside Japan as part of a new deal with Disney subsidiary Buena Vista International. Coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the release of the film, Rayna Denison curates this new collection to critically reflect on Princess Mononoke's significance within and beyond Japanese culture. The collection investigates the production, and re-production, processes involved in the making ofPrincess Mononoke into a global phenomenon and reevaluates the film's significance within a range of global markets, animation techniques, and cultures. In revisiting this undeniably important film, the collection sheds light on the tensions within anime and the cultural and social issues that Princess Mononoke explores, from environmental protection to globalization to the representation of marginalized groups. In this remarkable new collection, Princess Mononoke is examined as a key player during a major turning point in Japanese animation history.},

In the following, it looks at possible problems and effects of focalization. The argument concludes that dynamic focalization allows video games to apply narrative guidance without the linearity of a ``telling'' voice.},

  abstract = {The violence wrought by climate change, toxic drift, deforestation, oil spills, and the environmental aftermath of war takes place gradually and often invisibly. Using the innovative concept of "slow violence" to describe these threats, the author focuses on the inattention we have paid to the attritional lethality of many environmental crises, in contrast with the sensational, spectacle driven messaging that impels public activism today. Slow violence, because it is so readily ignored by a hard charging capitalism, exacerbates the vulnerability of ecosystems and of people who are poor, disempowered, and often involuntarily displaced, while fueling social conflicts that arise from desperation as life sustaining conditions erode. In this book the author examines a cluster of writer/activists affiliated with the environmentalism of the poor in the global South. By approaching environmental justice literature from this transnational perspective, he exposes the limitations of the national and local frames that dominate environmental writing. And by illuminating the strategies these writer/activists deploy to give dramatic visibility to environmental emergencies, he invites his readers to engage with some of the most pressing challenges of our time},

In his essay On Fairy Stories and a short poem entitled Mythopoeia, Tolkien makes the case that the fairy tale aesthetic is simply a more intimate version of the same principle underlying the great myths: the human desire to make meaning out of the world. By using mythopoeia as a touchstone concept, the essays in this volume explore how The Legend of Zelda series turns the avatar, through which the player interacts with the in-game world, into a player-character symbiote wherein the individual both enacts and observes the process of integrating worldbuilding with storytelling. Twelve essays explore Zelda's mythmaking from the standpoints of literary criticism, videogame theory, musicology, ecocriticism, pedagogy, and more.},

  abstract = {Whatever the original intent, the introduction of the term `thought experiment' has proved to be one of the great public relations coups of science writing. For generations of readers of scientific literature, the term has planted the seed of hope that the fragment of text they have just read is more than mundane. Because it was a thought experiment, does it not tap into that infallible font of all wisdom in empiricist science, the experiment? And because it was conducted in thought, does it not miraculously escape the need for the elaborate laboratories and bloated budgets of experimental science?                            These questions in effect pose the               epistemological               problem of thought experiments in the sciences:                                                          Thought experiments are supposed to give us information about our physical world. From where can this information come?                                         One enticing response to the problem is to imagine that thought experiments draw from some special source of knowledge of the world that transcends our ordinary epistemic resources.},

Inspired by medieval bestiaries and the increasingly visible effects of climate change on the planet, French researcher Nicolas Nova (born 1977) provides an ethnographic guide to the "post-natural" era in which we live, highlighting the amalgamations of nature and artifice that already co-exist in the 21st century. A sort of field handbook, A Bestiary of the Anthropocene aims to help us orient ourselves within the technosphere and the biosphere. What happens when technologies and their unintended consequences become so ubiquitous that it is difficult to define what is "natural" or not? What does it mean to live in a hybrid environment made of organic and synthetic matter? In order to answer such questions, Nova brings his own writing together with contributions from collectives such as the Center for Genomic Gastronomy and Aliens in Green as well as text by scholars and researchers from around the world. Polish graphic designer Maria Roszkowska provides illustrations. Printed in silver ink on black paper},

  abstract = {With the rise of online social networking, social relationships are increasingly developed and maintained in a digital domain. Drawing conclusions about the impact of the digital world on loneliness is difficult because there are contradictory findings, and cross-sectional studies dominate the literature, making causation difficult to establish. In this review, we present our theoretical model and propose that there is a bidirectional and dynamic relationship between loneliness and social Internet use. When the Internet is used as a way station on the route to enhancing existing relationships and forging new social connections, it is a useful tool for reducing loneliness. But when social technologies are used to escape the social world and withdraw from the ``social pain'' of interaction, feelings of loneliness are increased. We propose that loneliness is also a determinant of how people interact with the digital world. Lonely people express a preference for using the Internet for social interaction and are more likely to use the Internet in a way that displaces time spent in offline social activities. This suggests that lonely people may need support with their social Internet use so that they employ it in a way that enhances existing friendships and/or to forge new ones.},

The conversation then moves onto aspects of video game creation, such as the relationship between game design and narrative, player freedom and agency, environmental storytelling and the particularities of narrative in virtual reality, and the integration of features of narrative complexity.},

While demons can be seen as `loans' from Christianity, their representations in videogames often rely on syntheses of religious and secular sources, including Christian theology, world mythologies, conspiracy theory, and post-Miltonic literary appropriations of Satan as humanistic liberator and symbol of desire. These produce representations genealogically linked to but distinct from traditional Christian representations of demons. This paper looks at how the figuration of demons in recent videogames, primarily DmC: Devil May Cry (2013), and Shin Megami Tensei IV (2013), fit into the secular ideological legacy of the Enlightenment, in which the demon departs from purely a representation of evil and becomes recast as a polyvalent symbol capable of exploring a number of human themes, including desire, liberation, and control.},

The influences of such user empowerment have been debated, notably along the lines of the emergence of participatory culture (               Jenkins 2006               ). Increased fan participation in translation facilitated by technological environments is highlighting the need to pay attention to the role played by such highly engaged users in the localization industry. Yet, to date the topic has not been explored fully in game localization research. To fill this gap, this article considers the significance for game localization of the dynamically evolving status and influence of international game fan communities. Taking the case of a controversy that erupted during 2015 and 2016 over localization of a Japanese tactical RPG (Role Playing Game) title, the article investigates how user empowerment is impacting on game localization. This article demonstrates the importance~-- for game publishers and developers alike~-- of recognizing the increasingly significant presence of global game fan communities. In particular, game publishers and developers must be prepared to have clear and consistent localization policies and strategies in place in order to face the scrutiny of increasingly knowledgeable and empowered fan communities.},

This article challenges that notion by contrasting a cultural view of videogames with the dominant mere-technology view. Ecocriticism functions as a prestige language for videogames that permits entrance into what sociologist Pierre Bourdieu calls the field of cultural production. Ecology simultaneously provides metaphors for explaining videogame technology while allowing games to enter ongoing critical and cultural conversations. Humanists interested in but unfamiliar with videogames should therefore start with those with environmentalist themes. This article presents               Horizon Zero Dawn               (2017) as a case study.               Horizon Zero Dawn               presents a stylized pastoral pseudo-utopia that embraces ecofeminist calls to reconstruct rationality while challenging existing sexism in computing fields.},

In the original Beowulf the Grendelkin are not described as possessing many of the inhuman qualities that have been applied to them in the later critical tradition or by its translators. Isidore acknowledges in Etymologies that monsters are natural beings, whose function in the system of creation is significant. The present article considers the significance of the Grendelkin in the poem and argues that Grendel and his mother function as signs underlying themes of feud and succession in the poem. The article also brings attention to the multiple references to body parts, such as hands, and their function within the poem as synecdochic representations of the Danish body politic. The article explores the sexualised and gendered perception of the body politic in the poem.},

To fulfil this aim, it analyses the covers of the 20 top-selling video games in the United States each year from 2010 to 2014 (a total of 80 different games). Video game covers are a type of paratext, that is, texts that accompany another text to promote it and to guide its reading. Thus, video game covers choose and highlight some of the games' features over others, and by doing that they construct a discourse. In this article, it is argued that regardless of genre, the covers analysed convey and promote neoliberal values, such as freedom and choice, entrepreneurship, consumption and accumulation of goods, customization, novelty, individualism and meritocracy. This promotion of neoliberal values is combined with an appeal to the concerns of `risk society'. Thus, the covers of the top-selling video games play on fears linked to the new context created by the economic crisis while at the same time legitimizing the neoliberal ideal of the `enterprising self' as a model for dealing with it.},

Previous studies have tended to focus on game spectatorship from turn-taking ``non-players'' or live-streaming audiences, specifically. ``Just watchers'' are individuals who express no desire to play video games themselves, yet are avid spectators of others' video game play, both virtually and in-person. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 27 participants, this study explores their motivations for gaming spectatorship, as well as their aversion to playing games themselves. Findings suggest the ``work'' of playing games, lack of skill, access to games, and toxic online communities are deterrents to playing games. Participants expressed that games spectatorship offers them narrative engagement that is distinct from traditional media, and that despite ``just watching,'' they tend to consider themselves as part of gaming culture.},

  abstract = {Progressive and serious representations of homosexuality in Western mainstream video games are a recent phenomenon, and the Canadian developer BioWare has been instrumental in diversifying gender and sexuality representations in mainstream game culture. This thesis is an extensive study of the representational practices of BioWare's role-playing game series Mass Effect and Dragon Age. The study views games as important cultural texts. I approach the games through critical textual analysis drawing on theories from media studies, gender studies, game studies and queer theory, and I discuss how these games can be seen as reflections of, negotiations with and challenges to representations of sexuality and gender in contemporary Western mainstream media and games culture. The thesis provides a comprehensive qualitative theoretical, methodological and analytical contribution to the study of representations of sexuality and gender in games.  The current dominant industrial strategy for representing homosexuality in mainstream games is optional content which the player must actively pursue. In the BioWare games, homosexuality is primarily offered and represented through 'romances': optional romantic relationships the player can enter into with non-player characters (NPCs). In the analysis I make a distinction between 'public' and 'private' gameworlds. The former is the overall gameworld the player traverses during main quests and sidequests, and the latter is the sphere of player-pursued romances. I investigate the different representational practices of each type of world and discuss the complex relationship between representations, player assumptions and player interactions.  The study finds that the public gameworlds generally have a foundational heteronormative premise that is very careful and contradictory in what it represents and communicates, and which is complicated by possible player interactions. This premise weakens over time with subsequent game releases. The private gameworlds, on the other hand, can be much more explicitly queer and experimental with their representational practices, and explore queer themes not readily found in other mainstream media. The study also shows that while both series become more progressive over time, they generally have a strained and anxious relationship with male homosexuality, which reflects overall mainstream media attitudes on representations of male and female homosexuality.},

A hypothesis is formulated and then tested to see if it can be `falsified'. If falsified then that hypothesis must be discarded and replaced with a new, hopefully better one, which will, itself, then be tested. If a hypothesis resists falsification, and is supported by experimentation, it can be regarded as valid. `Valid', in this sense, does not mean `true', but merely that the principles behind the hypothesis can continue to be used until falsified and replaced by a better set of principles. An experimental, positivist approach can escape the shackles of simple historicism and empiricism, because it allows one to move beyond the limited range of options made available by records of the currently known world. It allows investigation of the counter-intuitive and for the possibility of deductive leaps, rather than simply relying upon probabilistic and inductive extrapolations of existing knowledge.},

This announcement was received by a public discourse of media panic wherein `brain rot' was understood primarily as a threat to young people's mental and physical wellbeing. This article seeks to challenge this discourse, building on the participatory approach to children's media scholarship to argue instead that `brain rot' constitutes a complex, and historically situated, genre of participation. Drawing on empirical data from seven TikTok workshops with 16- and 17-year-olds in Oslo, `brain rot' is conceptualised as a collection of related practices that (1) are childish or unserious, (2) provide no cognitive or developmental benefit, and (3) are deliberately non-productive. In this way, it can be understood as a decompression-driven genre of participation whereby young people actively resist the pressures of productivity and self-optimisation.},

Namely, I will tackle the main plot device of the show -- The Law of Surprise -- as being both a vessel of destiny, and that of a philosophical omnipotence. Furthermore, I undertake the strenuous and analytical task of painting the portrait of the show's main character -- Geralt of Rivia -- as both a deeply, morally-entrenched protagonist, and a product of an unforgiving and seemingly dysfunctional medieval society. I will interpret the ways in which his encounters with destiny, the characters of the show, and morality itself manage to shape up one of the most complex characters of modern television and pop-culture alike.Rezumat\^In articolul de fa\textcommabelow t\u a \^imi propun s\u a accentuez dualitatea \textcommabelow si contrastul materialelor surs\u a ce stau la baza seriei televizate The Witcher (Netflix), aduc\^and at\^at merite c\^at \textcommabelow si opuneri remarcabilei literaturi poloneze a lui Andrzej Sapkowski -- scriitorul din spatele \^intregului univers Witcher.

  abstract = {This thesis explores the modern reception of Old Norse literary culture in video games, a sphere of global popular culture which is heretofore unexplored in the field of Old Norse studies. This topic is relevant in light of the recent mass (re)popularization of Viking history and themes in the popular entertainment industry, exemplified not only by games but also by film and television. By focusing on the genre of medieval fantasy broadly, and how this genre is deployed in the medium of electronic role-playing games (RPGs), this recent rise in popularity is charted in the gaming world by reviewing four important titles made in the past fifteen years. This work represents the first stage of a larger project aimed at exploring the presence and transformation of Old Norse culture in broader popular culture, across media, and what these trends represent from social, political, and perhaps ecological viewpoints. As such, the thesis accomplishes two things: 1) It creates a new methodological and theoretical framework for the analysis of Old Norse elements in popular entertainment media (here, specifically video games) by drawing upon a range of other established academic fields, ranging from French structuralism to narratology, psychology of immersion, memory and reception studies, and more. 2) It demonstrates the application of this framework to the four video games mentioned previously, illustrating in relief the increasing popularity of Viking subjects in popular culture in the sphere of electronic games, and also making some observations about other entertainment media which demonstrate a preoccupation with the medieval North.},

  abstract = {Sex in video games has come a long way. Comparing the groan-inducing humor of Leisure Suit Larry or the meta-goofiness of Tomb Raider II to the more nuanced romance in modern games like Dream Daddy, Cibele, or To the Moon is inherently difficult because the former treats love like a joke and the later actually explores the pratfalls of intimacy. As games have increased in complexity---both aesthetically and in raw processing power---some have begun tackling sex with the same seriousness you'd expect from a high-brow novel or movie. But unfortunately, most games sink to the level of sexual discourse we see so often in popular culture where men feel entitled to women's bodies. Think of almost any teen comedy---Can't Buy Me Love, Weird Science, American Pie. Picture pretty much all the novels by the mid-century literary vanguard---Philip Roth, John Updike, Richard Yates. Return to the whiny emo music I stupidly worshipped as a teenager at the turn of the century. Video games are no different, and open-world games in particular have a tendency to treat sex as purely transactional. Obviously, this must change---at any time, but especially during this moment of reckoning in the wake of the \#MeToo movement.},

The first section explores the complexity of the human-nonhuman coexistence in relation to discourses of the Anthropocene, Capitalocene and Chthulucene. The second section engages more specifically with the ways in which these newly conceived entanglements challenge notions of time by allowing for productive ways to transform our understanding of endings and the potential of innovative cyclicality to arise.},

This is not, as has been suggested earlier, primarily a matter of the genre of the game, or a discussion of what an appropriate definition of a 'game' might be. Rather, in this study with hardcore gamers, playing computer games is a routine and mundane activity, making the boundary between play and non-play tenuous to say the least.

It is relatively common, however, for players to impose additional or alternative rules on video games, in order to refine or expand game play and to create new gaming experiences. This paper considers the implications of this phenomenon, dubbed `expansive gameplay', in context of video game studies and design. How does the existence of expansive gameplay help us to situate video games in relation to traditional games? To what extent is this phenomenon indicative of the ways in which players engage with video games? By theorizing expansive game play as a demonstrative example of the active, experimental, and exploratory nature of game play more generally, this paper endeavours to open further discussion about the relationships between players and the rule-based systems which constitute video games.},

  abstract = {Climate communication is seemingly stuck in a double bind. The problem of global warming requires inherently trans-scalar modes of engagement, encompassing times and spaces that exceed local frames of experience and meaning. Climate media must therefore negotiate representational extremes that risk overwhelming their audience with the immensity of the problem or rendering it falsely manageable at a local scale. The task of visualizing climate is thus often torn between scales germane to the problem and scales germane to individuals. In this paper I examine how this scalar divide has been negotiated visually, focusing in particular on Ed Hawkins\&rsquo; 2016 viral climate spiral. To many, the graphic represents a promising union of political and scientific communication in the public sphere. However, formal analysis of the gif\&rsquo;s reception suggest that the spiral was also a site of anxiety and negative emotion for many viewers. I take these conflicting interpretations as cause to rethink current assumptions about best practices and desirable outcomes for scalar mediations of climate and their capacities to mobilize a wide range of reactions and interpretations\&mdash;some more legibly political and some more complicatedly affective, yet all nevertheless integral to the work of building a holistic response to the climate crisis.},

  abstract = {This thesis, done in collaboration with Guerrilla, a subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment, will explore new merchandise possibilities for Guerrilla's hit game Horizon Zero Dawn, which is an open world action/adventure videogame set in a post-post-apocalyptic world, where nature has reclaimed the Earth and terraforming machines have turned violent against humans.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Guerrilla releases a new videogame every few years, meaning there is a period of silence of multiple years between every game release. To keep the Horizon Zero Dawn title still alive and relevant, the experience of the game will be translated into a physical product. Horizon Zero Dawn's current merchandise is quite safe and standard and does not translate the experience of the game well, and therefore a product expansion is advised.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Based on the strengths of Horizon Zero Dawn and the opportunities derived from a trend analysis, multiple search areas were explored, of which eventually a combination of two was chosen. One of the chosen search areas focusses on interactive objects, such as radio-controlled vehicles and modelling kits, while the other one focusses on creating environmental or cultural awareness.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Within the two chosen search areas many ideas were explored. This eventually led to the direction of self-sufficient enclosed ecosystems. Over time, the plants inside the ecosystem will grow bigger, and ``Mother Earth will slowly reclaim what has always been hers''. This perfectly fitting direction for Horizon Zero Dawn led to three different concepts.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;One of the concepts, the main focus of this project, is a limited art ``toy'' aimed at the ``hardcore'' fans of Horizon Zero Dawn, while the other two concepts are subtilized versions of the same idea.\&lt;br/\&gt;The subtilized concepts are both jarred ecosystems with a collectible figure inside of it. The two concepts vary in size and price, while only the more expensive ecosystem also includes an internal light.\&lt;br/\&gt;The concept for the ``hardcore'' fanbase also includes a self-sufficient ecosystem, but this one is placed inside a massive (250x250x225 mm) scale model of a Shell Walker. Furthermore, the concept works interactive with Horizon Zero Dawn by reflecting the in-game's events with (coloured) light effects. When not playing the game, the product can still be used as a wakeup light.\&lt;br/\&gt;All concepts keep the user interacting with the product once in a while, as they need to water or trim the plants. The concepts also add a touch of real nature inside a gamer's house, and thereby adding environmental awareness.},

  abstract = {This article demonstrates how creative decisions and emergent narratives within FromSoftware's award winning 2022 title, Elden Ring, represent and encourage a broader cultural shift away from the form of heroism popularised in the western world by Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Elden Ring's emergent narratives and gameplay encourage feelings of entitlement and nostalgia while simultaneously problematizing that entitlement. This article therefore reads the game as a demonstration of how Campbellian heroic narratives perpetuate toxic cycles of (self)destruction and shows players that they are a part of sociopolitical systems in decline, not outside observers. It begins by theorizing the place nostalgia holds in western culture, both resulting from the monomyth's ubiquity and in response to socio-political crises. Nostalgia is an increasingly influential marketing and rhetorical strategy that speaks to a pervasive assumption that there were ``better times'' one can return to through individual action. The article moves on to show how Elden Ring, despite being a Japanese game, resonates with this context due to its overt critique of archetypical notions of individualism and heroism. Specifically, this article demonstrates how Elden Ring implements an open world setting in conjunction with non-optional narrative events to foreground the limitations of agency and reframe the quest for redemption as a quest to satisfy one's own ego. The Campbellian hero in Elden Ring is depicted as a danger to the community, not its saviour.},

I investigate Mass Effect's loyalty mechanic and its genre mixture of the role-playing game with the military shooter to consider how BioWare's signature emphasis on team cooperation and supporting characters can express meanings that value American multiculturalism as exceptional, thus permitting forms of patriarchal and imperial violence to continue unabated. Finally, I consider how the player's choice to play as female rather than male can shift the player's experience from an imperialist attitude toward one of multiracial coalition that focuses on structures of patriarchal power and reproductive control.},

  abstract = {What do a bionic supersoldier, space stations and religious fanaticism have in common? They are all vital elements of the plot in Halo, a series of first-person shooter games developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft Games. One of the interesting things about Halo is that the developers made use of quite a number of religious images and themes, especially from the Christian tradition. In modern Western society, science and religion are often portrayed as polar opposites, and Halo appears to reaffirm this narrative. Yet it might still be interesting to look at how exactly this animosity is portrayed, and to see whether there is more to it. This paper is an inquiry into the significance of religious imagery and themes in Halo, as well as an attempt to place the game in the broader context of the geopolitical situation of its time. In short, this article is going to be a case study of how the relationship between science and religion can be explored through the medium of video games. For an overview of the current debate on how science and religion relate to one another in academia, I am going to look at the works of American physicist and scholar of religion Ian Barbour, American paleontologist and historian of science Stephen Gould, and British ethologist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. To justify the academic study of videogames I will be drawing from the writings of Dutch cultural theologian Frank Bosman. The analysis itself will consist of a summary of the game's main story, its portrayal of religion on the one hand and its depiction of science on the other, and its representation of how these two fields relate to one another. In the conclusion, finally, I will connect the dots between the different parts of the analysis and provide an answer to the main question.},

In particular, the game's brutal mise-en-sc\`ene, its intertextual references to popular war media, and its real and imagined opportunities for player choice create a discordant feeling that lays bare the problematic ease with which most video war games indulge in their nationalistic power fantasies. The result is a game that wields its affective distance as a critique of the necessary illusion that all military shooters trade in, but one that so few acknowledge.},

Broadly, these information displays included heads-up displays (HUDs), and alternatives such as spatial representations, and diegetic (in-game) indicators. Each experiment isolated a specific task common to FPS games: (1) monitoring ammunition, (2) monitoring health, (3) matching the weapon to the situation, and (4) navigating the environment. Correspondingly, each experiment studied a different information type, specifically ammunition (ammo) levels, health levels, current weapon, and navigation aids, while comparing HUDs to alternatives. The goal was to expose player performance differences between different classes of displays, and types of information displays (e.g., numeric, iconic, etc.). Results suggest that no one display type -- HUDs or alternatives -- are universally best; each performed well, depending on the type of information. For ammo, player performance was best with diegetic/spatial displays; for health information, players performed significantly better with a HUD. For weapon displays, results were best when showing a redundant HUD icon and a diegetic/spatial display (the actual weapon). Finally, for navigation, a spatial ``navigation line'' (showing the path) was best, but HUD-based mini-maps offered competitive player performance. We discuss implications for the design of first-person shooter games.},

We compared the performance offered by each ammunition display and player preference towards each. Results indicate that the diegetic "number-in-game" display performed best both in terms of reload time and shots taken between running out of ammunition and reloading. Participants fired an average of 35\% fewer shots after running out of ammo with the number-in-game display than with the worst performing display, icons-on-HUD. Reload time was also 26\% faster with the number-in-game display than with icons-on-HUD. The number-in-game display was preferred by 70\% of participants.},

Before outlining the practical use of 4CAT, we discuss three `affordances' that inform its design: modularity, transparency, and traceability. 4CAT is modular because new data sources and analytical processors can be easily added and changed; transparent because it aims to render legible its inner workings; and traceable because of automatic and shareable documentation of intermediate analysis steps. We then show how 4CAT operationalizes these features through a description of its general setup and a short walkthrough. Finally, we discuss how 4CAT strives for an `ethics by design' development philosophy that enables ethically sound data-driven research. 4CAT is then positioned as both an answer to and a further call for `tool criticism' in computational social research.},

The discursive struggle to define key aspects of the Great Recession, such as austerity, the virtuous ethos for facing precariousness, and rebelliousness, not only occurs in the political arena or information TV programs but also in the narratives of popular culture and videogames. This article analyses post-apocalyptic videogame bestsellers released between 2009 and 2017. Three ``utopian enclaves'' are identified, understood as discursive frames or referents associated with heroism and hope within these dystopian worlds: (a) ``Post-apocalyptic cowboys,'' (b) ``Back to nature and do-it-yourself,'' and (c) ``Community leaders, empathy and rebelliousness.'' The article concludes that it is important to analyse the representation of these ``utopian enclaves'' from a critical sociocultural approach.},

Focussing on the bat-wielding figure of Sh\=onen Batto and a cuddly pink doll called Maromi, it is shown how Kon Satoshi uses these figures to critique a range of fatalistic discourses on Japan's decline that have emerged since the bursting of Japan's economic bubble in the early 1990s. I argue Kon repackages the `vague sense of anxiety' prevalent in post-bubble Japan as monster in order to access the psychic realities of Japan, and as a tool for developing a critique of Japan's fear of and fascination with social monsters. Through analysis of key scenes, the article shows how Kon develops a rich dialectical understanding of Japan's on-going search for monsters, while also forwarding his own humanist view of social responsibility as method of navigating the ever-changing social environment of late-modern Japan.},

Using Gaudreault and Marion's notion of cultural series and wishing to spread a French theoretical approach we find very relevant to the discussion, we will question the bases on which we frame video games as cinema. This inquiry will focus on the audiovisual nature of both media and highlight their differing technical and aesthetic aspects, which will lead us to consider video games as being closer to other forms of audiovisual media.},

Key video games featured include Animal Crossing, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, The Legend of Zelda, Minecraft, PONG, Super Mario Bros., Tetris, and World of Warcraft. Each game is closely analyzed in order to properly contextualize it, to emphasize its prominent features, to show how it creates a unique experience of gameplay, and to outline the ways it might speak about society and culture. The book also acts as a highly accessible showcase to a range of disciplinary perspectives that are found and practiced in the field of game studies. With each entry supplemented by references and suggestions for further reading, Fifty Key Video Games is an indispensable reference for anyone interested in video games.},

In an age when the spiritual world is in crisis, Translating Myth constitutes a timely exploration of myth's endurance, and represents a consolidation of the status of myth studies as a discipline in its own right.},

Such systems of apprehension present the world as a place of constant moral striving, conducted against a background of interplay between the "divine forces" of order and chaos. "Order" is the natural category of all those phenomena whose manifestations and transformations are currently predictable. "Chaos" is the natural category of "potential" - the potential that emerges whenever an error in prediction occurs. The capacity for creative exploration - embodied in mythology in the form of the "ever-resurrecting hero" - serves as the mediator between these fundamental constituent elements of experience. Voluntary failure to engage in such exploration - that is, forfeit of identification with "the worldredeeming savior" - produces a chain of causally interrelated events whose inevitable endpoint is adoption of a rigid, ideology-predicated, totalitarian identity, and violent suppression of the eternally threatening other.},

Results demonstrated that the SCI was best described by four factors in combination with two method factors (i.e., one factor including only positively worded items and another including only negatively worded items). Analyses comparing SCI and method factors showed that positively and negatively worded items correlated differently with measures of citizen participation, psychological empowerment, and health-related quality of life. Results indicate that the SCI should be revised to exclude negatively worded items and new positively worded items should be developed and tested.

Because the novel resonates with the vibrations of the ancient Greek myth, it still twangs our sensibilities even in our demythicized and scientized modern world. ``Frankenstein lives on,'' writes Netherlands philosopher Henk van den Belt in Science magazine.1 Whenever your ears pick up alarming words such as hubris, or playing god, or Frankenstein, you know that the myth of Prometheus is being signaled. When ``the masters of science sought immortality and power,'' warned Mary Shelley, an uncontrollably violent monster was threatening.2 Today's Prometheus wears a white lab coat, sometimes experiments with living creatures, and plans for the future (pro-mathein means to think ahead). Today's threatening monsters come in the form of environmental degradation, climate change, engineering tomatoes with fish genes, genetically engineering the highly lethal H5N1 influenza, cloning Dolly the Sheep, transplanting pig organs into humans, and global nuclear war. These worries are affectionately known as Frankenfears. Are such fears realistic? Or, are they excessive, perhaps even paranoid? My answer is this: even though there is no sacred nature to retaliate against science, concerns are realistic when the risk of poor human judgment is not accompanied by foresight and cautionary planning.},

Hayao Miyazaki's epic fantasy broke domestic box office records when it came out in Japan, keeping pace with the success of Hollywood films like Titanic (1997). Princess Mononoke was also the first of Studio Ghibli's films to be distributed outside Japan as part of a new deal with Disney subsidiary Buena Vista International. Coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the release of the film, Rayna Denison curates this new collection to critically reflect on Princess Mononoke's significance within and beyond Japanese culture. The collection investigates the production, and re-production, processes involved in the making ofPrincess Mononoke into a global phenomenon and reevaluates the film's significance within a range of global markets, animation techniques, and cultures. In revisiting this undeniably important film, the collection sheds light on the tensions within anime and the cultural and social issues that Princess Mononoke explores, from environmental protection to globalization to the representation of marginalized groups. In this remarkable new collection, Princess Mononoke is examined as a key player during a major turning point in Japanese animation history.},

  abstract = {As memes circulate and spread throughout different Web communities, their meanings are continually changing. In the last decade, the website Know Your Meme (KYM) has become popular among researchers, educators, and day-to-day Web users to understand memes and their meanings. KYM is a frequently cited resource among Web researchers, and as a result it has become instrumental in establishing dominant histories of memes on the Web. Though KYM remains an invaluable resource, it is often cited with minimal context, and an uncritical reliance on KYM's definitions may overlook the polysemy of many memes. Accordingly, this paper uses a discursive interface analysis of the KYM website along with examples of incomplete meme definitions to demonstrate how the website constructs itself as a cultural authority to define and classify memes. Given that memes themselves are artifacts of Web history, I argue the overreliance on KYM as an authority on memes and their history can contribute to the homogenization of Web histories. However, this paper acknowledges that KYM can still be a useful resource and to that end, offers recommendations for how researchers might better introduce and contextualize KYM within their own work.},

The central objective is to identify several strands of conservative thought that emerge in the course of the Romantic era. Of these, one is indeed genuinely reactionary, implicitly secular, and Machiavellian in nature (Burke, Gentz, M\"uller, de Maistre), even as its exponents strenuously advocate the rights of the church and, in some instances, overtly espouse ultramontane positions. Of greater intellectual substance (and especially pertinent to my argument) will be another strand that draws on Catholic, pre-modern theology in order to undertake a comprehensive critique of political, economic, and moral assumptions and aspirations of the modern era to the French Revolution and beyond.},

Kennedy in 1963, and it has been remediated from historical anxieties about execution and brain death to the eye-popping spectacle of the exploding head to video games, where it has entered a regime that holds virtuosic reflexes as the highest form of capital. By examining the textual and technological history of the headshot, this article develops a theory of mechropolitics: a way of thinking about political death worlds as they operate in the mechanics of video games and digital simulations. Moving beyond questions of whether violence in video games has a direct effect on aggression, mechropolitics mobilizes aesthetic and social justice critique to unmask the affective structures operating within digital death worlds. These prioritize twitch reflexes and offer few consequences---precisely the scenarios that render events like police shootings both legible and likely.},

Many digital games draw on Gothic traditions to feature human-like monsters who demand morally complex interpretations from players. This study examines what kinds of moral evaluations players form of ambiguous Gothic monsters in Let's Play videos of the action role-playing game Fallout 3. With a discourse analysis of transcribed speech obtained from 20 Let's Play series on YouTube, it argues that the moral evaluations that players actively produce impact significantly on the play experience, that players take diverse moral stances whose (in)determinacy varies based on what players assume of their audience, and that players are morally autonomous by not hesitating to disagree with the game designers' moral ruling. Complex Gothic monsters function effectively as catalysts for the moral evaluations that can involve expressions of suspicion, sympathy for the underdog, begrudging acceptance, and betrayal.},

  abstract = {This dissertation research investigates the deployment of Gothic elements in   digital games and player experiences of Gothic monsters. The Gothic is a rich   and popular resource for games that, through representations of monstrosities   and injustice, aims to induce in players a pleasurable feeling of discomfort, yet   also reflects contemporary anxieties. The dissertation comprises three case   studies of which the first two are close readings of the action role-playing game   Fallout 3 and the third discourse analysis of transcribed player narration from   Let's Play (LP) gameplay videos. More specifically, the case studies discuss the   dual role of Gothic monstrosities as a cause and consequence of the dystopia   represented in the game world, Gothic ideology conveyed through multimodal   means in the game and the players' moral evaluations of its quasi-human   Gothic monsters. The data for the first two case studies consisted of notes and   screenshots systematically collected from the game, while the third case study   examined transcribed narration from 20 different LP series of the game   uploaded on YouTube. The findings show that, as well as monstrosities that are   to be defeated and feared, games can also feature complex Gothic villain-heroes   and sympathetic monsters whose actions and characterization are actively   evaluated by players, as demonstrated in gameplay videos. These evaluations   are influenced by whether the monsters are perceived as victims of injustice,   making certain actions forgivable, or treacherous and therefore abhorrent. Their   existence must make sense socially and biologically and be contextualized by   the game world so that they can potentially enlist player sympathy. Spatial   storytelling -- such as items and notes left in the game space -- can be used to   convey narratives of past ideological horrors. Games can also reproduce   traditional Gothic ideology such as othering, which takes on a dual role: players   distance themselves from characters perceived as tyrannical, whereas characters   ostracized by society evoke their sympathy. Players are morally autonomous   and negotiate morality via humour, gossip and swearing in LP discourse. The   Gothic continues to be complex, ambivalent, even contradictory in digital   games, producing a sense of uncertainty during play.},

  abstract = {As we edge closer to the looming ecological crisis of the Late Anthropocene, the fragility of the structures that insulate the human from the unpredictable violence of nature have become increasingly apparent. Ecophobia, that is, the irrational fear of nature and the non-human ecology, manifests across media. However, very few mediums let you walk through those narratives, choose your own path, and be held responsible for a chain of cause and effect. This chapter deals with the transgressive and abject ecoGothic monsters that stalk video games. Rather than being one of many, they are anomalous and `unnatural.'These video games have the primary ecoGothic feature of the abject or monstrous Gothic body, which is hybridized, mutated, or in some way transgressive of species. This is often expressed through the instability of form and fluidity of species. Some harken back to the degeneration theory of the Victorian era; others engage with 20th-century distrust of difference and the unknowable and still further are symptomatic of human hubris and interference. Despite the apparent malevolent nature of these videoludic monsters, their status as evil is often problematized through their vulnerability to the same vast and unfathomable forces as the player character. From games like Sekiro (FromSoftware 2019) that are structured around punishing boss fights connected through supernatural and ecological crises to puzzle games such as The Return of the Obra Dinn (Lucas Pope, 2018) in which the true monstrosity is gradually revealed, the monsters themselves are also victims. They are rendered monstrous through their trauma and otherness. This may be achieved through monstrous `technologies' such as hybridity, contamination, and unfathomability. Through video game narratology and eco-gothic theory, I will explore the complex connections between ecophobia and the video game monsters that stand between the player and their objective.},

Human self-interest and anthropocentric thinking act as barriers to communicating ecocrisis. Cozy video games can create safe spaces to explore the ecological effects of human actions with the aim of prompting reflection and action on environmental issues. Drawing on ecocritical video game scholarship, the aim of this article is to explore the ways in which environments are represented and interacted with in selected cozy video games. Through an examination of the extractivist colonial processes and narratives of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, in contrast with the complex ecocritical coziness of Terra Nil, this article posits that cozy games have the potential to achieve effective environmental communication. Both Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Terra Nil successfully empower the player to shape their environment but only Terra Nil affords ecological empowerment. By creating a safe space to engage with environments and even ecocrisis, cozy games allow players the agency to construct their own econarratives and may challenge or perpetuate anthropocentric ideas about the environment.},

For Plato, the answer lies with the ways people, groups, and institutions organize and behave.

Almost a third (32\%) indicated that they would use such tools; 15\% indicated that they had used them already. Neither personality (conscientiousness, agreeableness, Machiavellianism, narcissism), academic performance, nor study skills self-efficacy could predict future use of AI tools. A novel Degree Apathy Scale was the only significant predictor. Willingness to use AI tools was greater when the risk of getting caught was low, and punishment was light, particularly for those high in degree apathy. Findings suggest that degree apathy is a key risk factor in academic misconduct. Wider research and pedagogical applications of degree apathy are discussed.},

The content possibilities within this category, including for purposes as varied as celebrity productization and abusive puppeteering, are virtually limitless. But few remedial proposals for the deepfake phenomenon have fully accounted for the unique dignitary and property harms raised by posthumous deepfakes. This Note details those harms and considers the relevant remedies that may be pursued by surviving kin and other rightsholders associated with the deceased person being targeted. Based on current limitations with those remedies, this Note proposes that the tort of appropriation and the right of publicity are ideally suited to being statutorily federalized and reformed to protect the distinct dignitary and property interests implicated by posthumous deepfakes.},

False information can have severe consequences, as seen in the recent US presidential elections, the Brexit vote, and the COVID-19 pandemic response. False news can lead to radicalization, fear, and anti-social behavior both online and in real life. Addressing false information involves more than just labeling or filtering it on social media platforms. Cognitive biases like confirmation bias or the echo chamber effect can lead to distrust of such labels. The most effective solution is prevention through education, emphasizing critical thinking skills. It is therefore important to encourage students to think critically to be as resistant as possible to the influence of hoaxes. Given that frontal education does not appear to be an effective approach to developing critical thinking, other alternatives need to be sought. Game-based learning is gaining prominence as an effective educational approach. It offers advantages like increased student motivation, a secure environment for experimentation, and the development of crucial skills, including critical thinking. Several meta-analyses showed that games can improve critical thinking, but the effect depends on factors like game genre, mechanics, instructional approaches, learner demographics, and cultural nuances. Our work is dedicated to the qualitative analysis of games enhancing critical thinking, especially in the context of building immunity towards online false information. Our primary aim is to thoroughly examine these games and their game mechanics and comprehensively assess their advantages and disadvantages within the formal educational context. We systematically playtested selected games based on criteria related to usability in classrooms. We found, that most of these games are strongly story based, typically putting the player in the role of a hoax-monger or alternatively in the role of a fact-checker. The games offer easily understandable game mechanics to support fast onboarding, and therefore offer an effective educational tool to discuss and learn more about the risks of increasing amounts of false information in online space.},

Yet, little academic work has explored the motivations and sense of community that modders have. This study is the first quantitative survey of game modders, and combines quantitative survey data with qualitative interview material. Findings suggest that modders are both old and young, mod more than one game or game series, have a strong sense of community, and enjoy helping others. Many respondents had contributed to other mods or had co-authored mods, and modding communities may function as online collaboratories. Although some research stresses how modders hope to get jobs in the gaming industry, overall the industry was not a motivator for most respondents.},

The electrical activity of the brain is measured at selected sites to determine levels of awareness, e.g., activity in the beta, theta, and alpha states. A value is generated based on this measured electrical signal which is indicative of the level of awareness. The difficulty level of the game is increased as the awareness level value decreases and is decreased as this awareness level value increases.},

Studies have shown that PC game modders mod for a host of reasons not least of which as a means of developing the skills and portfolio needed to get a job in the video game industry. Modding culture can be thought of as a point of articulation between the industry and participatory cultural practices. Modding culture is not only concerned with accessing the game industry however, but also puts a high premium on modding for fun or out of love for a particular community or game. Because it effectively straddles market and non-market interests it is important to study how modders negotiate the two sides of modding, which has been at the leading edge of the participatory turn in media consumption and production. This article undertakes an evaluation of modding discourses, first through an evaluation of surveys taken by moderators of modding discussion forums and secondly through an evaluation of discussions regarding technologies used by modders. The article sheds light on the complex ways in which modders' understand the practice of modding. It is framed broadly within political economic theories that have attempted to map modding in post-industrial logics and within theories that have understood it as a participatory culture. Ultimately this paper discusses other participatory practices, drawing parallels with modding and venturing some observations about user participation in the new media environment.}

He writes that ``when the utopian oases dry up, we are left with a  desert of banalities and cluelessness''.i The present chapter addresses how a dominance of  dystopian narratives in contemporary popular culture together with a lack of utopian alternatives  reflects a petrification of politics that reifies a received status-quo rather than enabling necessary  changes. Ultimately, I argue our utopian potentials are wasted in hyper-commercialized  technological hypes rather than allowing them to foment political mobilisation.},

Through a critical reading of the first chapter of the history-based first-person shooter Call of Duty: Black Ops, the article demonstrates how the game's formal properties frame in-game experiences and performances, and this way predisposes the emergence of certain memory-making potentials in and through constrained practices of play. Subsequently, an analysis of the serious game Czechoslovakia 38-89: Assassination shows the potentials of game design to facilitate meta-historical reflections and critical inquiries.},

Utilizing critical whiteness and white framing theory, this study reviewed the discourse of Twitch influencers, who created YouTube reaction videos about the ban. All three of the influencers used rhetoric that sustained White supremacy like downplaying the impact of systemic racism, victimizing White men, and calling for freedom of hate speech.

The model  requires for player creation of a text or communication infrastructure that changes the  properties of the game from which play emerges not only for the player herself but for a  considerable group of players who share a particular practice of play. This change has to  be accomplished not only by playing the game but through changing how others play it in  a distinct creative activity. It needs to have the potential to subvert or contest the original  design of the game. This model is useful for understanding different kinds of player co- creation as well as the extend of co-creative game design and can be a tool for political  work towards participatory cultural production in games.},

The samples comprised various nationalities and ethnicities with mean ages from 9 to 19 years. For each study we obtained the standardized regression coefficient for the prospective effect of VGV on subsequent aggression, controlling for baseline aggression. VGV was related to aggression using both fixed [{$\beta$} = 0.113, 95\% CI = (0.098, 0.128)] and random effects models [{$\beta$} = 0.106 (0.078, 0.134)]. When all available covariates were included, the size of the effect remained significant for both models [{$\beta$} = 0.080 (0.065, 0.094) and {$\beta$} = 0.078 (0.053, 0.102), respectively]. No evidence of publication bias was found. Ethnicity was a statistically significant moderator for the fixed-effects models (P {$\leq$} 0.011) but not for the random-effects models. Stratified analyses indicated the effect was largest among Whites, intermediate among Asians, and nonsignificant among Hispanics. Discussion focuses on the implications of such findings for current debates regarding the effects of violent video games on physical aggression.},

A growing number of exploratory studies have applied self-determination theory to probe the psychological dynamics of problematic gaming, but little is known about these dynamics in adolescents---the targets of most concerns---or the extent to which dysregulated gaming, in turn, affects functioning. In our study of British adolescents and their caregivers ( n = 2,008), we adopted a confirmatory lens to test the extent to which basic psychological need satisfactions and frustrations underlie dysfunctional gaming behavior. The results, in line with preregistered sampling and data-analysis plans, indicated the frustrations, but not the absence of satisfactions, of psychological needs predicted adolescents' dysregulated gaming and psychosocial functioning. Our discussion focuses on the clinical significance of gaming dysregulation and the advantages of transparent scientific practices for research informed by, and meant to inform, APA and WHO guidance.},

In particular, the distinction between game topography and topology allows for finding and analyzing the different roles of heritage sites in games. At the core of the chapter are empirical probes based on the Czech games Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Hrot. The theses of the chapter are then complemented by partial findings regarding the representation of the past in the Slovak game Felvidek. The main conclusion based on the analysis is primarily a confirmation of the relationship between the way the historical landscape is portrayed and the commemorative acts that the game stimulates. Accurately depicted historical landscapes stimulate the discovery of historical artifacts (even in the real world), while more schematic depictions of memory sites rely primarily on historical meanings of places that originated outside the game.},

In this way, shared meanings (both as process and as outcome) are shaped which may or may not be called strategic decision-making. It is proposed that whatever name is given, it is simply a communicative device to shape future meanings (dialogue) and to generate further appropriate action (doing).

The public, media, and academia have commented on the significance of the Queue as a symbol of the relationship of the British to their monarch, as a social phenomenon, and as reinforcement of the stereotype that British people enjoy queueing and are skilled at doing so.},

Further, RMT is strictly forbidden in many massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) in the terms of service or user agreement players agree to in order to play the game. Using a case study methodology, developer terms of service and user agreements, reports on RMT from two popular MMORPGs, and websites purporting to sell virtual currency are examined.

An increasing number of residents use this World not only as a kind of virtual playground but as an enlargement of their real-life possibilities that has to be taken seriously: The users are both socially and religiously very active and consequently transfer real-life activities and therefore also rituals into virtual space.

Kerstin Radde-Antweiler presents and discusses gaming elicitation as a method for narrative interviews that intends to activate narrative storytelling within the respective interview. In addition, gaming elicitation helps the interview become more interactive between the interviewer and the interviewee(s). It uses elements from a game (e.g., videos of the gameplay). Its benefit for the study of gaming and religion is the possibility of triggering and collecting narrations on religion and gaming. This is of particular interest, since religion is mostly a sensitive issue that actors do not always wish to talk about explicitly.},

It is not surprising that a lot of research from the narrative perspective focuses on game design and how religious symbols are transferred as well as transformed within the game. The crucial question, however, is this: are these symbols relevant to the gamers or do they just serve as decorative framing? The article discusses gamevironments as an analytical concept based on the actor-centered approach, which integrates the analysis of the game narratives with a view to combining the narrative and the ludic approaches. Thus, "games/gaming" - "environments" - in short gamevironments - comprises two levels: the technical environment of video games and gamersas well as the cultural environments of video games and gaming.The article deals with a specific example of what is one part of gamevironments. One new "environment" of games are the so-called "Let's Plays" - increasingly and widely popular self-recorded gaming videos in which the respective gamers, the "Let's Players", comment on their journey through the game as well as on various aspects of it.},

  abstract = {In the Western cultural imaginaries the monstrous is defined\,--\,following Aristotelian categorisations\,--\,by its excess, deficiency or displacement of organic matter. These characteristics come to the fore in the field of bioart: a current in contemporary art that involves the use of biological materials (various kinds of soma: cells, tissues, organisms), and scientific procedures, technologies, protocols, and tools. Bioartistic projects and objects not only challenge the conventional ideas of embodiment and bodily boundaries, but also explore the relation between the living and non-living, organic and inorganic, human and nonhuman, as well as various thresholds of the living. By looking at select bioartworks, this paper argues that the analysed projects offer a different ontology of life. More specifically, they expose life as uncontainable, that is, as a power of differentiation that traverses the divide between the living and non-living, organic and inorganic, human and nonhuman, and, ultimately, life and death. In this way, they draw attention to excess, processuality and multiplicity at the very core of life itself. Thus understood, life always already surpasses preconceived material and conceptual limits. Finally, while taking Deleuzian feminisms and new materialism as its theoretical ground, the paper suggests that such a revision of the ontology of life may mobilise future conceptualisations of ethics that evade the anthropocentric logic dominant in the humanities and social sciences.},

  abstract = {The deep structural inequalities in the information ecosystem are increasingly visible as states vie for their right to govern information flows and technology, with profound ramifications on journalism far beyond their borders. This paper analyzes how a constellation of globally influential technology policies aimed at enhancing individual privacy and intellectual property (IP) rights, addressing content moderation, and mitigating online harms have been wielded by powerful government and business officials as a weapon to censor independent news media and deter investigative reporting. It argues that US and European copyright and privacy laws shape the visibility and viability of news media globally, from their ability to claim fair use and conduct investigative reporting in the public interest to the resources they must deploy to navigate these techno-legal systems. These effects are particularly pronounced when it comes to investigative reporting and news media, particularly in countries where political leaders do not engage with independent media and where state-aligned media often provide the main source of government information. It introduces the concept of moderation mercenaries and the use of strategic notices against public participation (SNAPPs) as helpful concepts for making sense of how these laws are weaponized. Malign actors have weaponized copyright and privacy laws --- and the technological infrastructure created by tech platforms to implement them --- to claim that journalistic articles infringe on copyright or restrictions on personal data and collection, resulting in critical journalistic coverage being erased from the internet and news archives. Content farms have further drained digital advertising coffers by plagiarizing and monetizing original news reporting. A failure to grapple with this dual-pronged reality risks further undermining media freedom and the viability of public interest news media. This paper shows how poorly designed and implemented techno-legal regimes empower wealthy and powerful individuals to intimidate and coerce the media into removing coverage while becoming essential tools in the arsenal of the public relations (PR) and reputation management firms that conduct influence operations around the world, to the detriment of press freedom and the fight against disinformation and corruption.},

This technology holds the capacity for challenging power in its production processes outside the state and market, its shift to informal speech and its intimate nature. Ultimately, this article argues that paying attention to sound through podcasts can extend our understanding of political listening and the media.},

These "docu-games" try to combine the facts of documentaries and the fiction of computer games---elements that seem hard to reconcile at first sight. Do these games create a harmonious "space of communication" in which feelings of mutual understanding occur between designers and players?},

Beyond that, I also discuss the importance of the conceptual cyborg's ability to be digitally embodied in virtual spaces, and this idea is expanded on through an examination of science-fiction television, video games, and even social media in relation to the conceptual cyborg. By examining contemporary cultural artifacts of the past two decades, I explain how we are all already conceptual cyborgs and how video games are able to serve as the best examples for the conceptual cyborg's powers of digital embodiment.},

Two often-cited attempts to clarify the fundamental components of games include the Mechanics--Dynamics--Aesthetics Framework and the Elemental Tetrad. This theory development paper attempts to reconcile these two frameworks into a single, clear and cohesive account of the kinds of elements that constitute games. The proposed theory not only includes all of the elements from its source frameworks but also introduces two refinements: (1) it differentiates game mechanics from narrative mechanics; (2) it distinguishes three types of narratives---stories told by the developers through the game, stories that emerge from gameplay and players' interpretations of game stories. The proposed theory should be useful for teaching game design fundamentals, as a coding scheme for qualitative data analysis and to analyse game design challenges. Subject to further clarification and extension, the proposed model may provide a basis for a general theory of digital games.},

However, this base of knowledgeable fans stands unique amongst standard translation practice, which seeks to iron out cultural specificities to create a text that reads flawlessly for a mass audience. This article therefore sets out to explain how videogame translators adopt targeted translation strategies to make their products more marketable to either a mass audience, the members of which may be ignorant, ambivalent, or even hostile to Japanese pop culture products, or to dedicated niche fan groups whose interest in Japan has been stoked by unofficial translations that frequently position themselves as the only avenue for accessing an ``authentic'' text. The final releases for eight pairs of Japanese games from the Role-Playing Game genre will be analysed to illustrate how far-reaching translation decisions have been used to make individual games more marketable to either group.},

In this paper, we seek to understand how human players collaborate with LLM-driven NPCs to accomplish in-game goals. We design a minigame within Minecraft where a player works with two GPT4-driven NPCs to complete a quest. We perform a user study in which 28 Minecraft players play this minigame and share their feedback. On analyzing the game logs and recordings, we find that several patterns of collaborative behavior emerge from the NPCs and the human players. We also report on the current limitations of language-only models that do not have rich game-state or visual understanding. We believe that this preliminary study and analysis will inform future game developers on how to better exploit these rapidly improving generative AI models for collaborative roles in games.},

  year = 2017,
  address = {England},
  urldate = {2018-11-20},
  abstract = {The cultural lifestyle sport of parkour maintains an ambiguous position at the nexus between deviance and leisure. It conforms to consumer capitalism's commodified norms of `cool individualism', risk-taking, and the creation of `deviant' identities, whilst remaining a spatially transgressive practice that is continuously excluded by the spatial guardians of the hyper-regulated city. Drawing upon ultra-realist criminological theory and a critical rethinking of leisure, consumerism and urban space, this thesis explains parkour's ambiguous position by suggesting that there is a fundamental paradox at the heart of parkour's spatial practice that is a product of late-capitalism's own making.  As Post-Fordist Western societies shifted toward a consumer-oriented economy, consumer capitalism had to stoke the desire for cool and alternative identities such as parkour that tapped into subjectivities increasingly oriented to socio-symbolic competition and individualistic distinction. Simultaneously, deindustrialised cities were regenerated through the commodified urban leisure economy, prompting a renewed reliance upon hyper-regulated urban spaces to harness and direct desire and identities and consumption into these commodified spatial contexts. Consequently, this thesis argues that the paradox of parkour is a dual-product of late-capitalism's cultivation of subjectivities geared to the pursuit of unique and culturally relevant identities, and a consumer economy that is reliant upon the hyper-regulated specificity of central consumer spaces. Consequently, consumer capitalism is caught in the double-bind of simultaneously promoting parkour whilst attempting to prohibitively direct it into approved and commodified spatial contexts. This is a paradox that has been entirely neglected in the academic literature on parkour, due in large part to the fetishisation of parkour as a form of `resistance'. This thesis challenges this fundamental assumption, drawing upon 28-months of in-depth ethnography among a parkour community in the North East of England.  It accesses the wider life-worlds of traceurs, following them not only through their illicit practice of parkour in the city, but through their attempts to `make it' in the commodified and professional world of parkour, cultural lifestyle sports, and social media fame. It explores the desires and motivations at the heart of the traceurs' practice and their attempts to preserve a sense of culturally-relevant identity while navigating the precarious waters of early adulthood in late-capitalism. Additionally, the thesis utilises walking interviews with security guards to supplement ethnographic observations around spatial governance, systemic spatial violence and the amoral economy of late-capitalist cities. As such, the thesis provides a critical rebuke to the romanticisation of parkour as a mode of proto-political resistance, and instead attempts to explain its ambiguous position in the deviant-leisure nexus through an in-depth analysis of urban change, consumer culture, and identity in late-capitalism.},

I analyze the three most popular sensitive-topic subreddits (r/Advice, r/AmItheAsshole, and r/relationship\_advice) and show that deleting submissions is common. Roughly half of submissions are deleted by their users, most within the first day and week. Interviews with 30 Redditors reveal that their motives for deletion include ensuring the ``Internet doesn't see them,'' especially those who might ``see it on my Reddit profile,'' deciding their issue was resolved, receiving unhelpful or aggressive comments, and concluding their submission was no longer relevant. Most interviewees were not overly concerned about deleted submissions persisting elsewhere (e.g., social media, archives, and datasets) as long as it is not easily connected to their other activity or identity.},

In R\"oki (Polygon Treehouse) and Knights and Bikes (Foam Sword Games), the child-avatars loosen the connection between maturity and self-reliance by framing interdependence as both an inevitable and a desirable condition of human society. Furthermore, by emphasizing children's supposed malleability, these games insist on the relationality of identities: they suggest that one's identity depends on the interactions one has with individuals and institutions. I suggest that by centering cooperation, these games destabilize myths of independence and autonomy that surround the lone hero of hyper-individualism and thereby challenge assumptions about the kinds of heroism videogames can portray.},

The basis of this research is to investigate video games as a medium for social change, and its application within a political context in order to encourage political participation in the United Kingdom. The research intends to critically analyse existing video game design theories with implications of social impact, such as transformative design, procedural rhetoric, ethical design, persuasive principles and the theory of play.

Of particular interest is the biopolitical dynamics of the Krogan lifeform. Due to population difficulties deriving from both naturalistic and cultural tendencies, they were targeted by a bioweapon -- the genophage. The genophage drastically transformed how they comprehend their own form of life, as the bioweapon infected the Krogan with a plague-like genetic modification targeting their reproductive organs. The player in the               Mass Effect               trilogy can cure the genophage or not, and reasons are provided to contextualize both options. In this article, I argue that the genophage problematic can be interpreted as a reflection on the attempt to affect a form of life from the outside. I emphasize what Tristan Garica describes as we-expansion: that               Mass Effect               leaves open the question of the possibility of expanding our sense of we. But               Mass Effect               also leaves open the question of we-contraction, in so doing it neither offers a utopian or dystopian political vision, but an agnostic one.},

Future game updates disrupted planetary climate and topography, forcing human players to abandon their homes and farms and relocate elsewhere. As an archaeologist, I was able to apply archaeological principles within a digital/human habitation while also investigating what became of the players and their constructions as well as their in-game community. This approach may well lend itself to efforts in the preservation of these digital environments, and especially for player-created content.},

The collection focuses on the ways in which gamers engage with, play with, recreate, subvert, reverse and direct the historical past, and what effect this has on the ways in which we go about constructing the present or imagining a future. What can World War Two strategy games teach us about the reality of this complex and multifaceted period? Do the possibilities of playing with the past change the way we understand history? If we embody a colonialist's perspective to conquer 'primitive' tribes in Colonization, does this privilege a distinct way of viewing history as benevolent intervention over imperialist expansion? The fusion of these two fields allows the editors to pose new questions about the ways in which gamers interact with their game worlds. Drawing these threads together, the collection concludes by asking whether digital games - which represent history or historical change - alter the way we, today, understand history itself"--},

What emerges from the game is a complex negotiation of two goals that often appear to be contradictory---fidelity to the conventions of gaming and attention to historical detail. By deferring to historical authenticity, the game attempts to build historical knowledge through sympathetic identification, which is precisely what the game fails to induce through its own narrative and characters. After treating Brothers in Arms, I conclude with a discussion of a very different game (Fa\c cade, 2005) as a way of speculating on future possibilities regarding the intersections of history and gaming.},

Although physically distanced from its cost to a historically unprecedented degree, the virtual proximity of the average citizen to war has never been closer. Military first-person shooter (FPS) gaming is a critical component of this dynamic, functioning as the principle means through which to consume and interact with war for a large and growing segment of the population. This influence is problematic. Although exceptions exist, military FPSs typically both reflect and sustain the ``war is hell'' myth: a conviction, reinforced through interactive gameplay, that the rules of war cannot, and indeed should not, apply to the battlefield. We argue that a more complete and nuanced integration of the laws of war into this medium would help shift popular understandings of armed conflict, and the legal restraints imposed on it, in a more positive direction and, at the same time, allow game designers to better fulfil their commitment to a ``realistic'' depiction of the battlefield.},

In film, television and books, female characters tend to talk less than male characters, talk to each other less than male characters talk to each other, and have a more limited range of things to say. Identifying these biases is an important step towards addressing them. However, there is a lack of solid data for video games, now one of the major mass media which has the ability to shape conceptions of gender and gender roles. We present the               Video Game Dialogue Corpus               , the first large-scale, consistently coded corpus of video game dialogue, which makes it possible for the first time to measure and monitor gender representation in video game dialogue. It demonstrates that there is half as much dialogue from female characters as from male characters. Some of this is due to a lack of female characters, but there are also biases in who female characters speak to, and what they say. We make suggestions for how game developers can avoid these biases to make more inclusive games.},

Some studies highlight the substantial carbon footprint of training and using LLMs, while others argue that LLMs can lead to more sustainable alternatives to current practices. We reconcile these narratives by presenting a comparative assessment of the environmental impact of LLMs vs. human labor, examining their relative efficiency across energy consumption, carbon emissions, water usage, and cost. Our findings reveal that, while LLMs have substantial environmental impacts, their relative impacts can be dramatically lower than human labor in the U.S. for the same output, with human-to-LLM ratios ranging from 40 to 150 for a typical LLM (Llama-3-70B) and from 1200 to 4400 for a lightweight LLM (Gemma-2B-it). While the human-to-LLM ratios are smaller with regard to human labor in India, these ratios are still between 3.4 and 16 for a typical LLM and between 130 and 1100 for a lightweight LLM. Despite the potential benefit of switching from humans to LLMs, economic factors may cause widespread adoption to lead to a new combination of human and LLM-driven work, rather than a simple substitution. Moreover, the growing size of LLMs may substantially increase their energy consumption and lower the human-to-LLM ratios, highlighting the need for further research to ensure the sustainability and efficiency of LLMs.},

The author argues that videogames can contribute to feminist scholarship by creating virtual spaces that simulate how a transnational politics of location plays out on women's bodies. This article provides a spatial analysis of three videogames, R\'epublique, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Alien: Isolation, to show how the games' procedures can persuade audiences to empathize with the surveillance and precarity of women's bodies in real-life transnational experiences. While the games focus on ``stealth,'' the limitations provided by the gameplay simulate the different ways in which women's bodies must ``sneak'' around national identities and rules, thus showing the ways in which a transnational politics of location creates ``contradictory positions. . . [for women who] inhibit unitary identities'' (Grewal and Kaplan 7).},

The Lord of the Rings is wise enough to recognize that there can be no happy ending for Frodo. Like Hamlet, Frodo can find no peace on earth. He has been too damaged in the process and has passed beyond all the normal hopes and desires of our world. At the end he is left to journey away with the Elves to a world that will undoubtedly fit him no better than this one. Beyond that, we presume he must find some new answer unique to Frodo, some way to transcend the limitations of life, as must each of us.},

The users of videogames can be vocal in their approval and disapproval, and in their suggestions on future implementation and changes. It has been demonstrated that their comments and requests have a direct effect on the next game, or future game, to be produced. The players are not passive receptors to videogames media, but active participants in a mutual relationship with those who create the videogames that they play. This paper provides an exploration of videogames, and on how their use are significantly embedded in the portrayal of female characters, in that portrayals and stereotypes can be (and are) both reinforced and challenged, and are in perpetual modes of creation and recreation through dynamics of interaction between game developers and gamers themselves. This study focused on the portrayal and perceptions surrounding the female character Samus Aran, the main protagonist featured in two of the Metroid games series: Metroid Prime and Metroid: Other M. Opinions regarding Samus Aran were sourced from online forum websites and games magazines including IGN.com, EDGE magazine and Metacritic.com. The evidence suggests that the videogame players' opinions and requests for various gameplay elements did influence the Metroid developers' later designs and modifications to the Sanus Aran character in later versions.},

Prior overall WoW experience and higher sense of social presence increase personal nostalgia scores (replicating previous research). Sense of place scores increased with higher sense of social presence but were overall lower for current WoW Classic players. Social presence proved an important component of both personal nostalgia and sense of place.

The authors conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of a focal discussion thread on r/EldenRing, a Reddit community, to examine how players lend each other support in response to the game's mechanical, affective, and interpretive difficulty. The findings demonstrate how affinity spaces can play an important role in helping players navigate challenging games like Elden Ring by providing a space for them to strategize, vent, joke, and even philosophize about their experiences with the game. Through this study, the authors suggest that game designers might extend their design perspectives to consider players' metagaming practices in affinity spaces, where they support one another to construct meaning of their suffering, perhaps leading to more players, more joy, and more joyful players.},

The essays in this volume address a number of pressing theoretical issues related to these areas, including but not limited to: the nature of performance and identity in videogames; their status as an interactive form of art; the ethical problems raised by violence in videogames; and the representation of women in videogames and the gaming community.

Game elements were introduced in the system as a way to engage students in writing tasks. A script based on the Hero's Journey was employed as a main guideline to structure the students' stories. An experiment with four students was carried out to evaluate the system's usability and the users' subjective satisfaction. A Think-Aloud protocol was used to collect data with participants. Results showed that in most of the users' answers (86\%) a positive feedback was given, both for the game's ease of use as well as for its application to support the storytelling process. \copyright{} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

  abstract = {The unreliable narrator is a popular narrative technique employed by game designers, as seen in games such as Dear Esther and The Stanley Parable. However, much of the academic discussion of unreliable narration in video games has focused on games with an omniscient, personified narrator. Through close readings of Tales from the Borderlands Episode 1 and Doki Doki Literature Club, we examine how video games without an omniscient, personified narrator create unreliable narration. Our findings suggest that in these games the auditory, visual and interactive (gameplay) narrative modes work together to create unreliability by setting up players to doubt the meaning of their in-game actions. This draws attention to the presence of an implied player to whom the unreliable narration is directed, and heightens awareness of the ``Game Narrator'' through metalepsis. We propose this Game Narrator as the set of rules that govern how the three narrative modes (auditory, visual and interactive) are dependent on each other, and how they support meaning-making and the formation of the cognitive construct of the storyworld in the player's mind.},

A total of 671 headlines were collected and analysed using inductive thematic analysis, theoretically informed by Agenda-Setting theory and Framing theory. The results offer an initial picture of how recent technological advances in the fields of AI have been communicated to the public. The results show that there is a complex and at times paradoxical portrayal of AI in general and ChatGPT as well as other Large Language Models (LLMs), oscillating between promising potential for solving societal challenges while simultaneously warning of imminent and systemic dangers. Further to this, the analysis provides evidence for the claim that media representations of AI are often sensationalised and tend to focus more on warnings and caution to readers, as only a minority of headlines were related to helpful, useful, or otherwise positive applications of AI, ChatGPT, and other Large Language Models (LLMs). These findings underscore the pivotal role of media discourse in shaping public perceptions of AI. The study prompts reflections on news media practices in the United Kingdom and encourages future research to further examine the influence of social, cultural, and political contexts on AI representation during a period of technological change. This research provides relevant insights for policymakers, AI developers, and educators to support public engagement with AI technologies.},

Using this combination, we explore the dramatic structure of Halo: Combat Evolved, comparing ludic and narrative structures at each stage of the game. Based on our analysis, we recommend that game designers recognise the importance of psychological states beyond flow, and structure gameplay to lead the player on a journey through different states. In particular, we defend the idea of pushing the player out of their comfort zone early in the game to provide motivation and positive stress, and ending the game with challenges below the player's level of expertise, to allow them to relax, reflect, and experience a sense of closure.},

  abstract = {Shortly after I had accepted the invitation to address this confer ence, I remarked to a friend of mine (a nonscientist) that I was going to address a conference on genetic engineering of animals. ``Ah,'' he said, ``the Frankenstein thing!'' I didn't pay much mind to his remark until perhaps a week later, when, while perusing the new acquisitions in our library, I encountered an extraordinary, newly published, 500-page volume entitled The Frankenstein Catalog: Being a Comprehensive History of Novels, Translations, Adaptations, Stories, Critical Works, Popular Articles, Series, Fumetti, Verse, Stage Plays, Films, Cartoons, Puppetry, Radio and Television Programs, Comics, Satire and Humor, Spoken and Musical Recordings, Tapes and Sheet Music Featuring Frankenstein's Monster and/or Descended from Mary Shelley's Novel (2). The entire book is precisely a descriptive catalogue, a list and very brief description of the works mentioned in the title. Amazing though it is that anyone would publish such a book, its content is Seven more incredible, for it in fact lists 2,666 such works (including 145 editions of Shelley's novel), the vast majority of which date from the mid-twentieth century. All of this obviously indicates that in the Frankenstein story is an archetypal myth or category which somehow speaks to or for twentieth-century concerns, and which could perhaps be used to shed light on the social and moral issues raised by genetic engineering of animals. My intuition was confirmed while visiting Australia and discussing with an Australian agricultural researcher the, to him, surprising public hostility and protest that his research into teratology in animals had provoked. ``I can't understand it,'' he told me. ``There was absolutely no pain or suffering endured by any of the animals.'' ``All I can think of,'' he said, ``is that it must have been the Frankenstein thing.'' And in its cover story on the 40th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, Time Magazine again invoked the Frankenstein theme as a major voice in post-World War II popular culture, indicating that it was society's way of expressing its fear and horror of a science and technology that had unleashed the atomic bomb (10).},

In a novel attempt to address this issue, we designed a psychological intervention in the form of an online browser game. In the game, players take on the role of a fake news producer and learn to master six documented techniques commonly used in the production of misinformation: polarisation, invoking emotions, spreading conspiracy theories, trolling people online, deflecting blame, and impersonating fake accounts. The game draws on an inoculation metaphor, where preemptively exposing, warning, and familiarising people with the strategies used in the production of fake news helps confer cognitive immunity when exposed to real misinformation. We conducted a large-scale evaluation of the game with N\,=\,15,000 participants in a pre-post gameplay design. We provide initial evidence that people's ability to spot and resist misinformation improves after gameplay, irrespective of education, age, political ideology, and cognitive style.},

  abstract = {The new prominence of alternate history in Western popular culture has increasingly prompted scholars to historicize it as a broader phenomenon. What has largely escaped notice until now, however, has been the question of the underlying function of alternate history as a genre of speculative narrative representation. In this essay, I argue that writers and scholars have long produced ``allohistorical narratives'' out of fundamentally presentist motives. Allohistorical tales have assumed different typological forms depending upon how their authors have viewed the present. Nightmare scenarios, for example, have depicted the alternate past as worse than the real historical record in order to vindicate the present, while fantasy scenarios have portrayed the alternate past as superior to the real historical record in order to express dissatisfaction with the present. The presentist character of alternate histories allows them to shed light upon the evolving place of various historical events in the collective memory of a given society. In this essay, I examine American alternate histories of three popular themes---the Nazis winning World War II, the South winning the Civil War, and the American Revolution failing to occur---in order to show how present--day concerns have influenced how these events have been remembered. In the process, I hope to demonstrate that alternate histories lend themselves quite well to being studied as documents of memory. By examining accounts of what never happened, we can better understand the memory of what did.},

The Comedy, and especially its first infernal cantica, gets periodically reinvented and transferred into creative outlets that are increasingly technology driven. This article will explore existing gaming adaptations of Dante's Comedy, to focus on the one hand on textual aspects that are mostly exploited to achieve commercial success and on the other on the potential offered by the text and often marginalized by developers.

LLM-based synthetic data build on fundamentally different epistemological assumptions than previous synthetically generated data and are justified by a different set of considerations.

  abstract = {Normativity is inarguably a major concept in the social sciences. Even so, social science research seldom acknowledges its importance, its influence on research inquiries, and its impact on the trajectories of communication science and on the scientists themselves. It is against that background that this article calls for a better understanding of the role of normativity in communication studies. In doing so, it analyzes Bourdieu's theoretical framework of field, habitus, and capital and how the intersection of all three concepts helps explain and justify the importance of norms in communication research. Finally, this article identifies differences between the norms of the orthodox and the heretics, based on various schools of thought and on paradigms from both U.S. and German communication--research histories.},

  abstract = {The practice of designing Interactive Digital Narratives [IDN] is often described as a challenge facing issues such as the ``narrative paradox'' and avoiding the unintentional creation of ``ludonarrative dissonance''. These terms are expressions of a perspective that takes narrative and interactivity as dichotomic ends of a design trajectory, mirroring an enduring discussion in game studies between positions often cast as ludologists and narratologists. The dichotomy of ludo versus narrative is, in itself, problematic and is often the source of the very conflict it describes. In this paper, we investigate this issue through the example of the cooperative game A Way Out, in which two players team up to break out of prison. The game is designed with a narrative twist, involving the escalation and final resolution of the game's competitive motif in the final scene. To understand the user experiences of this reveal, and the concomitant consequences, we engage in a discursive analysis of ``Let's Play'' videos as a largely untapped resource for research. By analyzing the interactions and performances in these videos, we can more clearly understand player responses to unsatisfying IDN design. As a result we introduce the notion of a `hermeneutic strip', extending Koenitz' SPP model to locate and describe the involved processes of narrative cognition in IDN work.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the general problem of the acquisition of positive affective responses, by study of the reversal of an innate aversion to the irritant properties of chili pepper. Interviews, observations, and measurements were carried out in both Mexico and the United States. Exposure to gradually increasing levels of chili in food seems to be a sufficient condition for preference development. Chili likers are not insensitive to the irritation that it produces. They come to like the same burning sensation that deters animals and humans that dislike chili; there is a clear hedonic shift. This could be produced by association with positive events, including enhancement of the taste of bland foods, postingestional effects, or social rewards. It is also possible that the initial negative response to chili pepper is essential for the eventual liking. Chili stimulates an innate sensory ``warning'' system but is not harmful. The enjoyment of the irritation may result from the user's appreciation that the sensation and the body's defensive reaction to it are harmless. Eating of chili, riding on roller coasters, taking very hot baths, and many other human activities can be considered instances of thrill seeking or enjoyment of ``constrained risks.'' Evidence for and against various explanations of chili ingestion is presented.},

Specifically, it confronts the rhetoric of ``empathy,'' which has become a buzzword in North American industry, academic, education, and media conversations about video games and their supposed power to place players into others' shoes---especially those games created by queer or otherwise marginalized people. Scholars like Wendy Chun and Teddy Pozo and game designers like Robert Yang have spoken out against this rhetoric. Building from their writing, as well as critiques from the creators of queer independent games commonly mislabeled as ``empathy games,'' this article delineates the discriminatory implications of the term. Rather than simply dismissing ``empathy,'' however, this article unpacks it, turning to textual artifacts like news stories and industry presentations, as well as the 2016 video game Unravel (ColdWood Interactive), to deconstruct the term's many meanings and to identity alternative (queerer) models of affective engagement with video games.},

Video games have always been queer argues that the medium of video games itself can - and should be - read queerly. In the first book dedicated to bridging game studies and queer theory, Ruberg resists the common, reductive narrative that games are only now becoming more diverse. Revealing what reading D.A. Miller can bring to the popular 2007 video game Portal, or what Eve Sedgwick offers Pong, Ruberg models the ways game worlds offer players the opportunity to explore queer experience, affect, and desire. As players attempt to "pass" in Octodad or explore the pleasure of failure in Burnout: Revenge, Ruberg asserts that, even within a dominant gaming culture that has proved to be openly hostile to those perceived as different, queer people have always belonged in video games - because video games have, in fact, always been queer},

In 2016, Chris Ryan's family was targeted by a terrorist cell. He didn't know who they were, or where they might strike. All he knew was that he wanted to keep his family safe. And since that's all any of us want, he decided to write this book. In SAFE, Chris Ryan has compiled all the personal security expertise he acquired during his time serving with the Regiment - he was awarded the military medal for his quick-thinking and survival instincts. He reveals the skills that kept him safe working undercover in Northern Ireland, on the dangerous streets of central Africa and in the war zones of the Middle East. He explains how civilians can employ these techniques to keep themselves: * Safe on the streets and in their vehicles * Safe in a fight or in the midst of a terror incident * Safe on aircraft or in hostage situations * Safe from cyber attacks * Safe in riots * Safe from sexual predators and much more. Chris Ryan analyses real-life incidents, such as the Manchester Arena bombing, the London Bridge terror attack and the Tunisian beach shootings, and explains how ordinary people should act if they find themselves in similar scenarios. And he reveals fascinating stories, never before told, about life in the Regiment and the dangers faced by SAS soldiers. In a world of ever-present, ever-changing threats, this is a book that will empower you to take personal responsibility for your own security.},

Notable among these is a series of videogame interventions, which have appropriated Western game products to convey political and religious messages through the inversion or complication of the roles of hero and enemy. This article explores a selection of such media, produced by or in support of two non-state groups, Hezbollah and Islamic State (IS). The article takes a discourse theoretical approach to examine the ideologies presented in these media and reflects on the ways in which these game artefacts engage with, and reject, Western narratives of history and of US pre-eminence. It concludes that while these game interventions challenge existing hegemonic (re)presentations of the Middle East and the `War on Terror', they remove or reduce agency to the extent that those who engage with them can only witness these challenges, rather than instigate their own. While we acknowledge that hegemony can always be challenged, we view this lack of agency as support for Mouffe's proposition that the result of counter-hegemonic resistance is often to maintain and reproduce the hegemonic order.},

This article analyses data as a form of capital that is distinct from, but has its roots in, economic capital. Data collection is driven by the perpetual cycle of capital accumulation, which in turn drives capital to construct and rely upon a universe in which everything is made of data. The imperative to capture all data, from all sources, by any means possible influences many key decisions about business models, political governance, and technological development. This article argues that many common practices of data accumulation should actually be understood in terms of data extraction, wherein data is taken with little regard for consent and compensation. By understanding data as a form capital, we can better analyse the meaning, practices, and implications of datafication as a political economic regime.},

  abstract = {Different mediums can dramatically alter how stories are told, how characters are represented, and ultimately, how we engage and respond as an audience. Narratives told through a digital medium are no exception, as these works can depict compelling narratives with elements such as animation, audio, and three-dimensional (3D) narrative environments. In fact, some of these narratives in digital media have been referred to as "empathy games," which denotes that these works can facilitate empathy for characters, including characters that represent a marginalized Other. The notion that a narrative in digital media can foster empathy for the Other prompts two problems which also emerge in literary studies: promoting empathy through narratives is not a controllable effect, and narratives cannot represent the Other without the risk of establishing or reinforcing stereotypes. This project takes up these issues by assessing four narratives in digital media, and this comprehensive analysis demonstrates that narratives in digital media offer a means to address these obstacles and ethical barriers. My project draws on the theoretical work of scholars, including feminist theorist Rosi Braidotti, philosopher Jacques Derrida, and post-colonial scholar Gayatri Spivak, who have proposed concepts and methods that work to disrupt hegemonic ideology that fixedly defines the Other as an oppressed subject. Drawing on their work, I reveal that their concepts and methods can take shape in digital media and destabilize the hegemonic ideology that otherwise informs a player's narrative interpretation and perception of the Other represented in the story. Additionally, I refer to the work of scholars such as Suzanne Keen to consider other obstacles in fostering narrative empathy and show that narratives in digital media provide methods to overcome some of these barriers. This critical examination reveals that narratives in digital media can address the long-standing ethical challenge of representation of the Other and overcome other obstacles that emerge on the pathway to fostering empathy for the Other.},

Based on an ethnographic study of five game jams and data from eight focus group discussions with game jam and VG community participants, this study explores five analytic and emerging dimensions of the VG community: meanings and perceptions associated with the VG community, feelings of belonging, issues of access, structure, and organization, and contexts of participation. These results improve our understanding of the ways participants in VG communities can be seen as creators of game culture and how VG communities are recreating the concept and experience of community in contemporary societies.},

The collection focuses on the ways in which gamers engage with, play with, recreate, subvert, reverse and direct the historical past, and what effect this has on the ways in which we go about constructing the present or imagining a future. What can World War Two strategy games teach us about the reality of this complex and multifaceted period? Do the possibilities of playing with the past change the way we understand history? If we embody a colonialist's perspective to conquer 'primitive' tribes in Colonization, does this privilege a distinct way of viewing history as benevolent intervention over imperialist expansion? The fusion of these two fields allows the editors to pose new questions about the ways in which gamers interact with their game worlds. Drawing these threads together, the collection concludes by asking whether digital games - which represent history or historical change - alter the way we, today, understand history itself"--},

Given the increasing interest in enterprise gamification, it is useful to evaluate how it has evolved and its acceptance via a multidisciplinary lens. It is also critical to assess frameworks and approaches applied in understanding the trend. The current article concludes that a value-oriented approach is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of enterprise gamification acceptance and users' experience, particularly in today's workforce that is largely dominated by millennials. \copyright{} 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Written on 4Chan message boards by a user named Jadusable (Alex Hall) in 2010 and later archived by creepypasta enthusiasts, Ben Drowned relates the saga of a college sophomore s encounter with a bootleg copy of The Legend of Zelda: Majora s Mask (2000) supposedly possessed by the spirit of its former owner. Over the course of two weeks, Jadusable records his experiences in writing and short videos as the entity within the cartridge torments him, eventually taking control of his technology and escaping into the Internet. After a brief overview of theories of the uncanny and haunted media, this paper will conduct a narratological analysis of the Ben Drowned saga in order to explore the aesthetic and social potential of haunted cartridge narratives, especially how they can reveal the inherent uncanniness of games as a medium. Haunted cartridge narratives like Ben Drowned help to elucidate unsettling ambiguities between data and spirit, save files and human identity. Through stories like these, the information-carrying cartridge is revealed to mirror the body/soul duality so familiar to humanity, housing data, which may be possessed, altered, and corrupted by entities unknown. The errors and glitches commonplace in contemporary gaming technologies are recast within the work as being of uncertain and perhaps malicious origins, distorting once familiar digital spaces with the disquieting efficiency of an unseen hand. As such, this under-analyzed piece of digital fiction resonates with cultural fears regarding the primacy of incorporeal information within contemporary network society and casts the medium of the video game as a space ripe for encounters with uncanny entities.},

Drawing on his four decades as a professional historian, Shlomo Sand interrogates the academic discipline of history, whose origin lay in the need for a national ideology. In the last few decades, traditional history has begun to fragment, yet only to give rise to a new role of historians as priests of official memory. Working in Israel has sharpened Sand's perspective, since the role of history as national myth is particularly salient in a country where the Bible is treated as a history book. He asks such questions as: Is every historical narrative ideologically marked? Do political requirements and state power weigh down inordinately on historical research and teaching? And, in such conditions, can there be a morally neutral and 'scientific' truth? Despite his trenchant criticism of academic history, Sand would still like to believe that the past can be understood without myth, and sees pointers for this in the work of Weber and Sorel"--Provided by publisher},

In addition, the book proposes a new perspective on fans and popular culture, arguing that the modern self is reflected and constituted through media consumption. In developing his account, Sandvoss draws on theoretical ideas in an original yet accessible way, and uses a wide range of examples, from Star Trek to Madonna to football, to illustrate his argument. This makes `Fans: the mirror of consumption' an ideal text for upper-level undergraduate and postgraduate students studying fans, audiences and consumption in all areas of contemporary culture.},

Given the differences between existing games and their capabilities, the exact function of these games in an urban planning curriculum is unclear. The city-building game Cities: Skylines currently has three different versions (Digital, Tabletop, VR). Through an affordance analysis of the game's three versions, this study analyses how the versions afford four primary knowledge dimensions, and in doing so identifies different educational applications for each version of Cities: Skylines in different planning disciplines. The results show that: (a) the board game is strong in fostering player participation and critical thinking more suited for the social and health studies, public policy, and citizen participation domains of urban planning; (b) the digital version functions as moddable simulator, ensuring familiarity with existing systems and monitoring their effects, useful in logistics and transportation planning; (c) the VR form viscerally involves players in the simulated processes, applicable in design-focused segments of urban planning, such as sustainable design theory, housing, and land-use management. The results of this study can help urban planning educators identify possible uses for different versions of Cities: Skylines.},

  address = {Santa Barbara, CA},
  abstract = {Millions of people are spending billions of hours each week playing digital games. These astonishing numbers point to a vast reservoir of psychic material that has been relatively unexamined by the field of depth psychology. Yet, in a realm of virtual games where image is primary and fantasy is played out, soul (psyche) is clearly present in its various disguises. Through play and fantasy, unconscious content of the psyche is able to express its deep longings. Hypnogogic landscapes of video games provide immersive realms in which players enact psychological dramas. However, to date most psychological research of game experiences has been primarily empirical analysis within cognitive behavioral psychology and neuroscience. The question of soul-making within games is rarely approached. In this qualitative interdisciplinary study of game studies and depth psychology, the relationship between digital games and psyche is explored through the lens of archetypal psychology. The overarching goal is to address whether the constructs of archetypal psychology provide an adequate psychological framework for understanding the phenomena of digital game worlds. This study looks primarily to archetypal psychologist and Jungian psychoanalyst James Hillman, to ground the research in depth psychological concepts of archetype, image, and soul. Hillman's four concepts of personifying, pathologizing, psychologizing, iv and soul-making, as conveyed in Re-Visioning Psychology (1975/1992), provide the guideposts for the structure of interviews with four prominent game narrative designers, fieldwork discussions, and hermeneutic investigation of the literature. The results of this dissertation demonstrate games as a virtual theater where psyche can play; the psychological necessity of personification and regression through fantasy; the role of archetypes in the creation process of game experiences; and the importance of archetypal influences within game realms for broader and richer context for soul's participation. In addition, this study provides initial languaging allowing archetypal psychologists and game designers to enter into both game analysis and exploratory conversations, resulting in deeper meaning-making in gameplay. This work introduces depth psychologists to the important domain of digital games for soul and suggests to game designers a new access path as game designs evolve in new directions},

  abstract = {`Gamer' culture perpetuates an oppositional mindset, rather than acknowledging the affective, transformative experiences videogames can provide. The focus on challenge, mastery, and conflict is deeply rooted in most definitions of the medium, but the notions of configuration and cybernetics can help to develop a more dynamic and inclusive understanding. Three examples of videogames that already offer alternative play experiences are discussed here: Prince of Persia (2008), What Remains of Edith Finch (2017), and The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit (2018). They foster a sense of responsibility and empathy, not empowerment and entitlement. While both Edith Finch and Captain Spirit include elements of challenge, unlike Prince of Persia, here they are primarily used to harness the emotional power of ludic involvement connecting the player to the secondary realities and the characters. This communicates the possibility of an alternative set of societal values where humanity is an inclusive, unified and dynamic notion, based on inter-relationships. An understanding of videogames as designed systems of opportunities, constituted by affordances and constraints, fosters a sense of systemic awareness, leaving players better equipped to critically reflect upon, accept, and internalise the experience of consequences. Thus videogames, more so than any other form of cultural expression, can provide profound moments of personal, but also collective and societal affective transformation. As an inherently cybernetic and configurational medium, they can shape players into truly autonomous and responsible transhuman citizens.},

Activism, by contrast, was constructed as focused on making social change, and not driven by commercial interests. This article argues that the research participants' discussion of the differences between `influencer' and `activist', and the attribution of monetisation to influencers, underplays the ways in which market logics help to structure contemporary forms of activism that take place in the digital economy. Second, the article places the investment in forms of activism that are uncompromised by commercial pursuits in the wider context of feminised and exclusionary cultures of perfection. Lastly, the article reflects on common constructions of influencing as a feminised as well as trivial pursuit and cautions against accounts that uncritically present influencing as trivial in contrast to activism, which is considered more serious.},

They appear to us as grotesque spectacles that trouble the borders of existence such as: the animate corpse, a man-eating plant, or a murderous child. Monsters surface frequently in Magic: the Gathering on the cards that players collect and construct decks with. A highly developed mythos informs the game that is set in the Multiverse: a macrocosm comprised of countless planes of existence, where a dazzling array of beasts and horrors abound. In 2010, Wizards of the Coast (the game maker) introduced a new creature into the lore, the most terrifying and improbable species in the entire Multiverse. But what would the monster par excellence look like and behave in a world where monstrosity reigns, where demons, giants, and dragons are everyday occurrences? Enter Magic's interpretation of the symbolic Other: the Eldrazi Titans and their progeny. They are transgressive not only in their creature design and visual appearance, but in their unique interactions within actual gameplay.},

Academic research on the possibilities and effects of satire in games is minimal, if compared with other rhetorical uses of playful interaction. This paper contributes to our understanding of satire in games by discussing and annotating design decisions that were meant to be taken satirically. More specifically, the focus of this paper is Construction BOOM!, a tile-laying boardgame designed by the some of the authors of the paper (Gualeni and Schellekens) themselves with the overt intention of satirizing the current situation of real-estate development in Malta. Part of our contribution consists in leveraging the notion of the 'implied designer' as articulated by Van de Mosselaer and Gualeni to show how game elements participate in the player's inferring a satiric implied designer for the game. The paper highlights the opportunities available for designers to implement satire into the various elements of a game and opens the door to further research into exploring how much these elements influence the perception of satire by players.},

  abstract = {Contrary to a prevalent impression within the research community, pseudo-science is far from a marginal phenomenon, far from being a mere epiphenomenon in the mediascape. As this article shows, it constitutes a dominant trend since the 2010s, especially in historical and archeological television documentaries. These documentaries enjoy high ratings, which partly explains why producers continue to make them. Thus, omnipresent in the mediascape and beyond, they outcompete the scientific consensus and the worldview it projects, regardless of the debunking efforts of researchers and journalists. Furthermore, pseudoscience publications enjoy sales volumes that even the most renown researchers can only dream of. This omnipresence of pseudoscientific discourses in the social sphere transforms representations, increases beliefs in the paranormal and encourages conspiratorial mindsets. The comparative analysis of two documentaries: Lost World of the Maya (National Geographic) (NG) and Ancient Aliens\copyright : Secret of the Maya (AA), has revealed a great number of similarities. Their format is identical, with the same number of segments, separated by synchronous commercial breaks of equal lengths (give or take a few seconds). If they somewhat differ in terms of treatment (AA proposes to uncover a conspiracy, and NG to solve an enigma) and the structure of the argumentation (AA: narration, assertion, speculation; NG: description, question, interpretation), they both show the same archetypal images of the Maya culture and mobilize the same enunciative modalities: a voice-over commentary ensures coherence throughout, interspaced with snippets from specifically invited ``experts'' whose task is to illustrate, specify, justify\dots. the overarching narrative. And yet, although many appear on screen, their speaking time is unequally distributed, with one (NG) or two (AA) speaking the most, and the others barely a minute each in total. Thus, their similarity is such that it is accurate to speak of variations within a media format. More precisely, we can only reaffirm Marshall McLuhan's observation that ``the medium is the message'', as, beyond the scientific or pseudoscientific narrative, the very dynamic of the media predominates, blurring the distinction between the two.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, a closer relation has arisen between games and activism, between games and war, between games and the city - what can be called as a gamification of certain regions of the world. What is the power of the game over life? Often the game imposes a kind of subjectification. The game's rules demand reflexive acts from the player. The player engages with the game's pre-programmed interactions, losing minutes and hours to the fascination of overcoming the challenge. And yet players also design and play their own games, thereby seizing back some of that which was lost to the game's digital regime. My underlying concern in this book is this power grab from the game. I understand these acts as player-driven transformation of an existing game into another, as a transformative process I refer to as ludic mutation. The remaker of games sees the world not as a given, fixed place composed of static objects, but as play material, to be reconfigured. Over the course of this writing, I investigate these player-driven changes to the game at varied scales and points of intervention, across gaming culture, in unique online communities of players, among artists, activists, and situated within the city - both in the digital game city and the augmented, mixed reality city},

As a result, the violence exacted by such changes poses representational and motivational challenges to human abilities to address them. I tackle the question, as a scholar from outside the discipline of religious studies, how might Buddhist thought provide valuable tools for people interested in working progressively at the intersection of violence and human-induced environmental degradation? Like other non-specialist Westerners, I have cobbled together an eclectic Buddhist perspective. I aim to explore affinities between certain Buddhist themes and my own professional orientation and expertise in earth science. To that end, I describe concepts of time derived from geological science and Asian mythical traditions; probe ideas about violence in relation to global environmental degradation; and, consider implications of the Noble Eightfold Path, the way to deliverance from suffering taught by the Buddha, for adjusting systemically to environmental change over time. By expanding, scientifically and spiritually, what the present moment can be, an instant of infinite duration, I hope to connect my journey towards taking a long view of a moment with the long view of change that human beings require to awaken to violence that is at once potentially catastrophic and so slow, that it's difficult to discern and therefore counter.},

By critical theory, it refers to the intellectual ``fight [against] ideological mystification, class oppression, and hegemony with the goal of changing society for the better'' in the Frankfurt School tradition (Felluga, Introduction 2015: xxiii). Firstly, it explains how the game\quotedblbase s cryptic style invites players to reflect on their in-game surroundings. Environmental storytelling and its impact on the ludonarrative of BLOODBORNE stand at the focus of this theoretical prelude. Secondly, the paper sketches the traditionally difficult stance of video games in critical theory thinking. It pays special attention to Nick Dyer-Whiteford and Greig de Peuter\quotedblbase s Games of Empire in which they discuss how video games do, in fact, provide critical input. Thirdly, a close reading of BLOODBORNE follows. Focusing on the game\quotedblbase s ideological world, the role of the player-avatar within it, and the game\quotedblbase s endings, the paper shows how the game encourages player-communication in a culture of critical debate and knowledge sharing. It fourthly explains how this kind of online-collaboration exemplifies a potential mode of postcapitalism according to Paul Mason.

A unique category within that broad spectrum of storytelling is myth. Throughout the ages, mythic narratives have found representation in all forms of art: paintings, theatre, and literature are only a few examples that validate this claim. Recently, since the inception of video games, myth has found a new medium in which to manifest itself. Considering that the medium largely shapes the exact manner in which stories are presented, and subsequently deciphered, this raises several questions. How are mythic narratives incorporated and interpreted in the video game medium? What connects myth and video games? What is the role of human participants within this complex phenomenon? In order to answer these questions, I will conduct a case study: I will apply the hero narrative as Joseph Campbell presents it in The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949) to FromSoftware Dark Souls video game trilogy (2011, 2014 and 2016 respectively). This dissertation will therefore focus on narrative analysis.},

To illustrate the political agency of videogames, the paper first considers the entanglements of videogames and gamer culture in the anti-progressive backlash that has accompanied Donald Trump's presidential campaign and presidency by looking at the GamerGate harassment campaign. The article then provides a critical reading of Ubisoft's Far Cry 5 (2018), which demonstrates how the videogame (re)produces reactionary ideologies. Far Cry 5 repeatedly employs tropes and narratives steeped in American colonialism, expresses a yearning for the past and its way of life, and works through a logic of taking back the country under the feeling of having one's home taken away by strangers. As it thus evokes a sense of `making America great again,' Far Cry 5 exemplifies the political resonance of videogames in the ongoing phenomenon of Trumpism in the United States.},

Items were designed to measure players' gaming experiences as they developed requisite skill sets and learned game content. Specifically, this investigation examined how participants' age ranges and levels of expertise relate to hebaviors, strategies, and skills exhibited with an MMOG environment. Although results are not necessarily conclusive, implications for understanding gaming expertise in contemporary educational environments are discussed.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with how recipients evaluate the reality status of media products, how they distinguish and how they interrelate elements of``fact'' and ``fiction.'' On the basis of an overview of recent theories of fictionality, an approach comprising three independent perspectives for evaluating the reality status of media products is proposed:a pragmatic perspective concerning the product type (``fact,''``fiction,'' and ``hybrids''), a semantic perspective concerning product content (degrees of plausibility), and a perspective of mode referring to the (perceived) realism of the product (formal features and their effects on degree of involvement). Under all three perspectives, a media product will usually contain cues that orient the recipient toward ontic status, plausibility of content, and so forth. This model is then applied to a media product transcending the traditional boundaries between``fact'' and ``fiction,'' the pseudodocumentary horror film The Blair Witch Project and its reception. To study the reception, a random sample of e-mails from Internet newsgroup discussions of the film is subjected to content analysis. A first analysis shows that among those e-mails written within six months after the release of the film, 38 percent refer to questions concerning its reality status. A second analysis explores the perspectives from which this reality status is discussed and whether the recipients regard the film as fiction or as nonfiction. While most discussants correctly identify it as fiction, almost 40 percent are at least temporarily uncertain as to the product type. To substantiate their perceptions of or their doubts concerning the film's ontic status, both recipients that consider it to be fiction and recipients who are uncertain frequently refer to information gathered from other media. By comparison, cues that permit the unambiguous identification of the film as fiction (impossible content elements, disclaimer as part of the credits) are only rarely given as reasons. These results show that novel, unfamiliar hybrid genres have the potential to confuse recipients and thus temporarily provide a way for``fiction'' to enter ``life.''},

Chapters on the origins of English, German, Dutch, and the Germanic language family as a whole illustrate how the history of the sounds of these languages provide a key that unlocks the secret of their genesis: speakers of Latin, Celtic and Balto-Finnic switched to speaking Germanic and in the process introduced a 'foreign accent' that caught on and spread at the expense of types of Germanic that were not affected by foreign influence.

Each film transforms the aging witch from stock villain to a more nuanced character. This revision is intriguing for its concern with power and gender and for a reflection of contemporary debates about age and power within so-called wave feminism. The article uses two frames. The first is feminism and ageism, focusing on wave feminism and aging, and the second is the trope of the witch, drawing from fairy-tale studies, social history, and social anthropology. The article reads conflict between an aging witch and a young woman as a clash of feminist waves, and the witch's `monstrosity' as her refusal to be sidelined in a world obsessed with youth.},

Specifically, we find evidence of collective trolling, as bombed product reviews are 20\% shorter, but have 83\% more negative emotion, 25\% more anger, and 130\% more controversial words.

Virtual dystopias rely on a combination of engaging narrative elements and gameplay mechanics, which come together to create dynamic worlds in which players are active participants.},

One of the oldest fears about art is that it may corrupt  observers and lead them to immorality  -  a criticism that has resurfaced  with attacks on video games. Fallout 3 does the opposite. It  encourages players to think about the morality of their actions in the  virtual world, thereby teaching them the practical wisdom that Aristotle  considered essential to being a moral actor.},

The author recorded gameplay footage of World of Warcraft, and World of Warcraft Classic. After this, an ethnography was conducted at the 2019 Blizzcon convention, in which observation shots and interviews took place. This footage was edited together to form a visual ethnography medium, in which the data and findings are presented. The results are that the popularity around World of Warcraft Classic is not because of the game itself, but rather the idea that it was a step in the right direction to giving the fans a sense of agency and say in the game's future development.},

By using Michel de Certeau's notion of a spatial practice and Paul Virilio's discussion of the violence of speed as frameworks for the discussion, this paper articulates two conceptual definitions by which to classify speedruns - finesse runs and deconstructive runs. Finesse runs are those in which the narrative architecture of the gamespace is largely left intact while deconstructive runs are those in which Virilio's violence of speed is on full display as de Certeau's narrative boundaries are torn down by the player. Distinct from but vital to the discussion of speedrunning in relation to games as narrative spaces is an articulation of two sets of rules that a player encounters in a game - implicit rules and explicit rules. Implicit rules are those which exist by virtue of Huizinga's Magic Circle, by virtue of an assumption that the virtual world of a game is whole. Explicit rules are those which actually govern the game, the rules that speedrunners seek out in an effort to circumvent entire sequences of gameplay. Speedrunning is shown to be a spatial practice within a spatial practice, or a Practiced Practice.},

  abstract = {This thesis is concerned with speedrunning, the practice of completing a video game as quickly as possible without the use of cheats or cheat devices as well as the community of players that unite around this sort of play. As video games become increasingly ubiquitous in popular media and culture, the project of accounting for and analysing how people interact with these pieces of software becomes more relevant than ever before. As such, this thesis emerges as an initiatory treatment of a relatively niche segment of game culture that has gone underrepresented in extant game and media scholarship. The text begins by discussing speedrunning as a community. By chronicling the community's beginnings on SpeedDemosArchive.com and examining its growth with the emergence of contemporary content hosting sites like YouTube and Twitch, this thesis presents speedrunning as a collaborative and fast-growing community of practice made up of players who revel in playing games quickly. From there, an analysis of space and speed, both natural and virtual, is undertaken with a view to understanding how speedrunning as a practice relates to games as narrative spaces. Discussions of rule systems in games and within the speedrunning community itself follow. It is ultimately argued that speedrunning is a museum of accidents, a re-curating of a game according to what this thesis calls its explicit rules. This claim is expanded upon through the coining of a concept dubbed curatorial play as well as several case studies of developer responses to various games being speedrun.},

Speedruns are shown to be an example of what the author calls `curatorial play', or play that is intentionally preserved and organized with a view to being shared. Speedrunning in particular is shown to re-curate a game by exhibiting glitches (accidents) that allow the game to be viewed in a different light by player and spectator alike. This notion of player as curator is then used as a lens to examine various developer responses to speedruns that the author has observed.},

  abstract = {Game scholars have critiqued ludic magic systems for their rational, quantifiable, and wonderless nature. Yet, despite the magic system's prevalence in modern games, the field of game studies lacks a formal theoretical framework to analyze how these systems---and the framing fictions they inhabit---go about articulating a sense of enchantment to players. To address this gap, this article proposes a novel method for close-reading ludic magic systems based on Antoine Faivre's ``definition of enchantment'' from the field of Western esotericism. The article describes examples of Faivre's four esoteric qualities---correspondences, living nature, imagination and mediations, and experience of transmutation---as they appear across twelve different games. These examples illustrate how the logics of premodern enchantment, which underlie ludic representations of magic, can evoke awe and wonder in the player by providing alternative ways to knowing and being in fantasy gameworlds.},

The book is divided into five sections, covering topics such as, myth and psychoanalysis; hero myths; myth and science; myth and politics; and myth and the physical world. Chapters engage with Freud, Jung, Popper and other thinkers, demonstrating how myth still plays a vital role in our communities and individual identities. The synthesising of these theories allows the reader to see that myths tend to be the result of a need, either material or existential, rather than a spontaneous creation. This is a fascinating survey by a leading voice in the study of myth. As such, it will be of great interest to scholars of myth and how it interacts with Sociology, Anthropology, Politics and Economics"--},

The story of The Witcher series is about a witcher named Geralt of Rivia. Geralt on the journey of evil hunting is narrated to the audience in a fantastic way. Although Geralt is an anti-hero fighting evil in the series, he himself stands on a very fine line between good and evil. This situation is noticeable not only in the main character of the series, but also in other prominent characters and reflects ``the lesser evil'' phenomenon throughout the series. From this point of view, The Witcher series, which conveys how the boundary between good and evil, can be transitive and relative and has been discussed through the concept of lesser evil.},

Other species, elements of the natural world, and people are active participants in relations overflowing with communications, interactions sometimes recorded in ethnographies, or as `myths' and `stories'. The present article draws upon a range of traditions to explore the biases which shape how indigenous and traditional life-ways are represented in westernized contexts; the phenomenon of receiving direct insight or intuitive knowing from more-than-human worlds; and the numerous valuable understandings regarding the nature of the human being, other species, and how to live well, that are offered by a deeper comprehension of different worldviews. I also argue that the various capacities for instinctual and intuitive knowledge which accompanies these life-ways are endemic to the human species yet overlooked, the correction of which might work to usefully recalibrate our ethical relations with each other, and with other life on earth.},

When participants assessed after a delay were compared to those measured immediately following game play, violent game players showed decreased aggressive thoughts, feelings and behavior, whereas nonviolent game players showed increases in these outcomes. Experiment 3 extended these findings by showing that exposure to nonviolent puzzle-solving games with no expressly prosocial content increases prosocial thoughts, relative to both violent game exposure and, on some measures, a no-game control condition.

In a media landscape dominated by such gamers, players who do not fit this mold, including women, people of color, and LGBT people, are often brutalized in forums and in public channels in online play. Discussion of representation of such groups in games has frequently been limited and cursory. In contrast, Gaming at the Edge builds on feminist, queer, and postcolonial theories of identity and draws on qualitative audience research methods to make sense of how representation comes to matter. In Gaming at the Edge, Adrienne Shaw argues that video game players experience race, gender, and sexuality concurrently. She asks: How do players identify with characters? How do they separate identification and interactivity? What is the role of fantasy in representation? What is the importance of understanding market logic? In addressing these questions Shaw reveals how representation comes to matter to participants and offers a perceptive consideration of the high stakes in politics of representation debates. Putting forth a framework for talking about representation, difference, and diversity in an era in which user-generated content, individualized media consumption, and the blurring of producer/consumer roles has lessened the utility of traditional models of media representation analysis, Shaw finds new insight on the edge of media consumption with the invisible, marginalized gamers who are surprising in both their numbers and their influence in mainstream gamer culture.

  abstract = {Post-millennial writings function as a useful prism through which we can understand contemporary English culture and its compulsion to revisit the immediate past. The critical practice of hauntology turns to the past in order to make sense of the present, to understand how we got to this place and how to build a better future. Since the Year 2000, popular culture has been inundated with representations of those who occupy a space between being and non-being and defy ontological criteria. This Pivot explores a range of contemporary English literatures - from the poetry of Simon Armitage and the drama of Jez Butterworth, to the fiction of Zadie Smith and the stories of David Peace - that collectively unite to represent a twenty-first century world full of specters, reminiscence and representations of spectral encounters. These specters become visible and significant as they interact with a range of social, political and economic discourses that continue to speak to the contemporary period. The enduring fascination with the spectral offers valuable insights into a contemporary English culture in which spectral manifestations signal towards larger social anxieties as well as to specific historical events and recurrent cultural preoccupations. The specter confronts the contemporary with the necessity of participation, encouraging the realisation that we must engage with it in order to create meaning. Narrative agency is the primary motivating force of its return, and the repetition of the specter functions to highlight new meanings and perspectives. Harnessing hauntology as a lens through which to consider the specters haunting twenty-first century English writings, this Pivot examines the emergence of a vein of hauntological literature that profiles the pervasive presence of the past in our new millennium.},

Unpacking the discourses surrounding ``video game culture'' allows us to see the power dynamics involved in attributing certain characteristics to it, as well as naming it ``video game culture'' as such. This has implications for how video games are studied and is connected with how culture is studied more broadly. By critically examining how video game culture has been defined in both press and academic articles, this paper illuminates how this definition has limited the study of video games and where it can move.},

  abstract = {What does it mean to look at the monstrous? For many people, monstrous embodiment in its many forms arouses discomfort that is more or less successfully managed through the medium of our differential senses. While the creation of an interval between self and other through sight and representation allows for a reassuring self-security, there is also the sense of a certain destabilising `yuk' factor present. Yet, our persistent fascination with the monstrous speaks to a profound longing that may manifest not just in curiosity about the strange, but as a form of desire. In critical cultural studies, the complications of Freudian and Lacanian desire clearly provide a platform for understanding the seductiveness of the monstrous, but are now more often surpassed by the celebration of a reconfigured and wholly positive desire in its Deleuzian sense. At the same time our longing for the monstrous denotes a desire for the grasp of knowledge and for the domestication of anomaly. As such I want to expand on the familiar uneasiness that showing images of the monstrous potentially provokes and its putative encouragement of an undoubted voyeurism, to engage instead with a Derridean exhortation to preserve the strangeness, and with an reparative reading through Deleuze that offers reasons to be hopeful.},

  abstract = {Recent generations of frontier language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established mathematical and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from data contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces' structure and quality. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of compositional complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs ``think''. Through extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counter-intuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where additional thinking in LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models experience complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.},

We refer to this effect as `model collapse' and show that it can occur in LLMs as well as in variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity among all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it must be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of LLM-generated content in data crawled from the Internet.},

Our findings suggest that players focused on inanimate resources are less committed than players who focus on social aspects of the ritual events inside the game.

The paper explores how Valiant Hearts, as a kind of informal institution affecting historical remembrance, constructs and encourages a specific framing through the deployment of Europeanizing elements of anti-war narrative, Franco-German reconciliation narrative, and the de-nationalizing logic that indirectly legitimizes the European integration. The analysis of the videogame in the context of the historical film Merry Christmas (2005) is complemented with a close reading of illustrative empirical examples of Let's Plays (paratextual user-generated videos where people record themselves while playing videogames) that indicate how Europeans of different national backgrounds interact with the game Valiant Hearts. The examined cases point to how the everyday, seemingly apolitical leisure activity of playing and watching videogames dealing with history can advance Europeanizing narratives and present occasions for informal Europeanization.},

In the first part we trace a brief profile of the Child God, concentrating on its main mythemes: the agro-cyclic destiny, the centrality of death and the fatal relation with the Mother Goddess. In the second part we track these mythemes in Arkay, who holds the title of <<God of the Cycle of Birth and Death>>, oversees burials and funeral rites and has a maternal-mortuary connection with two goddesses, Mara and Namira. Through the fil rouge of the Child God archetype, our research proves the extraordinary coherence characterizing a portion of The Elder Scrolls Lore, whose creators, not differently from every artist of any age, always draw on the same archetypal material stored in the collective unconscious.},

The global video game culture is inherently asymmetrical, with games produced in particular regional centers dominating the markets. As a result, local video game production and consumption are intrinsically hybrid cultural practices that accommodate cross-cultural encounters. This article analyzes the personal, institutional, and cultural dimensions of video game production and consumption in two increasingly important, yet understudied, regions: Eastern Europe and the Middle East. It uses case studies on the Czech and Iranian gaming scenes as examples. Beyond the politico-economic aspects of video game production, the article empirically analyzes the manifestation of Czech and Iranian gaming cultures on social networking sites and their connections to global game culture. It examines the audiences of global, Iranian, and Czech gaming sites on Facebook and explores their similarities, differences, and affinities through normalized social distance computed based on their fans' likes. Overall, the article aims to offer a more nuanced picture of game cultures across diverse global contexts.},

This study examines a selection of gaming websites, to consider their pre-release Cyberpunk 2077 coverage and the discrepancies between these early reports and the released game. Using inductive conventional content analysis, framed as thematic analysis, 148 press articles were investigated divided into nine subcategories, and three categories. These articles told an almost exclusively positive narrative, promising great performance and features. The uncritical reception of publisher information by journalists allows the authors to propose the notion of ``broken promises marketing''. The article contextualizes this term in the gaming ecosystem, arguing that over-optimistic marketing is amplified through features of the online press ecology. Finally, the results are considered from a business ethics perspective, with a set of communications recommendations for both journalists and game publishers.},

Standing strong by Eivor's side. From Norway to England. To Mythical Realms of the Gods. Thank you for taking this journey with us. SKAL! \#AssassinsCreed>> (Twitter-konto @assassinscreed 2022a). At the time, the Viking-themed installation in the series, Assassin's Creed Valhalla (Ubisoft 2020; hereafter ACV), had been available for almost two years. Ubisoft's pre-release marketing campaign had promised players <<the ultimate Viking fantasy>> (Phillips 2020), after assuring potential customers that the Vikings historically speaking were better than their reputation. The game trailer invited players to <<think like a Viking>>, <<live like a Viking>>, <<fight like a Viking>>, and <<conquer like a Viking>> (IGN 2020). In the global games industry, AC is a highly popular brand and Ubisoft a central supplier. The reception of ACV, which has been overwhelmingly positive, has strengthened the company's position in Viking-themed popular culture. With a reputation for offering ``historical authenticity'' by means of virtual reconstructions of specific cultures in specific historical eras, the AC series is an interesting object of study. This is all the more underscored by the fact that the series is partly marketed for use in education. At the same time, ACV is only one of a long and growing list of Viking-related cultural procuts. In this article, I ask what we can learn by studying ACV's Viking image in a ludic perspective, and how that approach may contribute to our understanding of the contemporary popularity of Vikings. Employing the terms Viking power, Viking identity, and Viking spirituality, I hope to offer tools for understanding the complex field that is the use of Vikings and the Norse past today.},

  abstract = {"Although for half a century East-Central Europe was part of the Soviet empire and was subject to its "civilizing" mission, its colonial status escaped the attention of most postcolonial critics. It still remains a blank spot in global studies of postcolonialism. In Polish Literature and Identity: A Postcolonial Landscape Dariusz Sk\'orczewski argues for the advantages of applying postcolonial thought to Polish realities; at the same time, he modifes the theoretical framework worked out by other postcolonialists. The book seeks to reveal how Poland's two lines of experience-one of foreign hegemony since the late 1700s through 1989 (excluding a short period of sovereignty between the two world wars); and the other of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as itself a pre-modern empire-have shaped the culture of contemporary Polish society. The book focuses on identity transformations as reflected in Polish literature and critical discourses. It opens up the question of the identity of a postcolonial nation in contemporary East-Central Europe where globalization and cosmopolitanism clash with growing national sentiments, making predictions about a speedy advent of a post-national era premature. The first few chapters are devoted to the postcolonial theorizing of Poland in the East Central European context. This part of the book seeks relevant language(s) and registers for the analysis of the cultural condition of East Central Europe as a part of the world which slipped most postcolonial critics' attention. The second part of the book (Chapters 7-11) deal with the effects of the colonial encounter on Poles' self-perception and perception of Others, as reflected in Romantic and modern Polish literature. The book closes with a Postscript titled "Three Warnings," outlining a critique of postcolonial theory and criticism"--},

The interaction between these two aspects of the game puts Morrowind in a particular position at the point of interaction between theology and computer game design. By seeking to balance the competing demands of an explicitly prophetic main story with a free-form user experience, Morrowind produces an effective synthesis of both narrative gaming and theological prophecy in a new light which changes the common paradigm of both. This paper aims to trace and highlight the way in which this tension has been resolved within the game, relying on a voluntary understanding of prophecy and a distinct approach to narrative urgency.},

Specifically, I argue that nostalgia is a positive emotional response that can be elicited in players without the need to embed period or historical referents in games. Extending this, I argue that the experience of nostalgia might enhance player motivation to explore game spaces, which has repercussions for game design. This paper makes use of existing literature on the psychology and aesthetic qualities of nostalgia to develop an initial theoretical basis for the study. To explore the implications of affective nostalgia, a case study analysis of two recent games is presented. Both of these games are dependent upon player motivation to explore their game worlds.},

Theories of pastiche and parody as applied to literature, film, and art are used to form a basis for the examination of recent nostalgia videogames, all of which demonstrate a degree of reflection on the videogame medium.},

This paper examines the impact of automatic and player-initiated difficulty adjustment on player experience through two studies. In the first study, 40 participants played the casual game THYFTHYF either in motion-based or sedentary mode, using menu-based, embedded, or automatic difficulty adjustment. In the second study, we created an adapted version of the commercially available game fl0w to allow us to carry out a more focused study of sedentary casual play. Results from both studies demonstrate that the type of difficulty adjustment has an impact on perceived autonomy, but other player experience measures were not affected as expected. Our findings suggest that most players express a preference for manual difficulty choices, but that overall game experience was not notably impacted by automated difficulty adjustments.},

Karl Marx launched the modern debate on determinism with his provocative remark that "the hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist," and a classic article by Robert Heilbroner (reprinted here) renewed the debate within the context of the history of technology. This book clarifies the debate and carries it forward.Marx's position has become embedded in our culture, in the form of constant reminders as to how our fast-changing technologies will alter our lives. Yet historians who have looked closely at where technologies really come from generally support the proposition that technologies are not autonomous but are social products, susceptible to democratic controls. The issue is crucial for democratic theory. These essays tackle it head-on, offering a deep look at all the shadings of determinism and assessing determinist models in a wide variety of historical contexts.},

The former belongs in the world of David Ickeand a myriad of other conspiracy theorists, whilst the other is a fluid termnormally used to designate a distinct way of thinking in a context confinedto early fifteenth-century Europe until the twentieth century. However, oncloser inspection and by using Antoine Faivre's six-point typology ofesotericism (with the addition of a seventh criterion, gnosis), this articleplaces Icke's seemingly strange and random discourse within an esotericframework. Despite the warning from Antoine Faivre twenty-five years agothat New Religious Movements (NRMs) do not sit well within his typology, Ilocate Icke's conspiracy theories within the context of Esotericism becausewhen Faivre wrote Access to Western Esotericism (1994) both NRMs andthe New Age were not yet `seated at the table' of the academic study ofreligion. Twenty-five years on they are firmly within the purview of religiousstudies scholarship. It is useful to view Icke as an esotericist rather thanmerely a conspiracy theorist as his beliefs so clearly reflect an individualinfluenced by New Age discourses. Through the application of Faivre'smethodology, Icke's theories are re-contextualised and examined within anesoteric context, enabling them to take on a religious meaning rather thanjust a conspiracist one. Drawing on Joseph Dan's approach to esotericismas a way of viewing the world, rather than a term prescribed and inscribedby history, I seek to bring both Faivre and his indicia into conversation withthe study of NRMs. Using Faivre's six-point typology and his definition ofgnosis this article places Icke's conspiracy-based discourses within anesoteric framework.},

On a Silver Platter marks a "coming of age" for CD-ROMs as a commercially and aesthetically significant medium demanding critical attention. Greg Smith brings together media scholars such as Lisa Cartwright, Henry Jenkins, Janet Murray, and Scott Bukatman to analyze how CD-ROMs offer alternatives to familiar places\texthorizontalbar to museums, to cities, and especially to classrooms. Examining specific CD-ROM titles, including, Sim City, Civilization, and Phantasmagoria, the contributors argue that CD-ROMs are complex texts worthy of close consideration, both for how they have changed our understanding of space and genre, and for how they will impact the development of future media. By examining particular CD-ROM texts and contexts, On a Silver Platter probes this new medium for insight and understanding into the current state of multimedia and into the future of technology.},

  abstract = {Emergence has been suggested as one of two basic game structures that distinguish between open and closed gaming paradigms: games of emergence and games of progression. The first category relates to most traditional games and also some videogames. It encompasses games that, starting from a relatively small set of elements and rules, can have a multiplicity of possible outcomes. The second one refers to games in which the player needs to complete a series of predefined tasks in order to advance. This is the case of some traditional games, such as treasure hunt, but also of the majority of existing videogames in which solving puzzles and quests, or overcoming obstacles organized in screens or levels are the basis for progressing in them. This article argues that the use of emergence in games research falls short in capturing the full potential of such an intricate concept. Clarifying the term and its use can help expand this theorization of games, separating what refers to -- or is a result of -- an open space of possibilities and what is indeed emergence in a strict sense. Distinguishing the notions of open and emergent widens the discourse on game design. It will allow game scholars to account for self-organizing phenomena in digital games on one hand, and for the appearance of emergent novelty on the other, both during the design process and in respect to the model player of the game.},

In this paper we turn to the video game RuneScape, a free-to-download, massively multiplayer online game where players produce goods, become specialists, and go on quests with other players. Because the economics is apparent from the outset, instructors can use it to immediately engage with their students.

To overcome these constraints, this study presents a prototype system that enables large language model (LLM)-powered NPCs to communicate with players both in the game en vironment (Unity) and on a social platform (Discord). Dialogue logs are stored in a cloud database (LeanCloud), allowing the system to synchronize memory between platforms and keep conversa tions coherent. Our initial experiments show that cross-platform interaction is technically feasible and suggest a solid foundation for future developments such as emotional modeling and persistent memory support.},

Like these writers, his work now holds a hugely popular and important place in the literary imagination of his country. Unlike them, his work is only recently coming to the attention of readers from overseas. "Kokoro" joins the recent publications of "The Gate", "The Tower of London" and "the Three Cornered World" from Peter Owen as part of an international programme to bring one of Japan's best known authors to a new English speaking audience. As Damian Flanagan says in his new critical introduction "Kokoro" is the Soseki novel that has been given most attention by critics and the public in Japan. On one level, a meditation on the changing face of Japanese culture and its attitudes to honour, friendship, love, death, it is also a sly subversion of all of these things. The novel centres around the friendship between the narrator and the man he calls Sensei, who is haunted by mysterious events in his past. As the friendship grows and the narrator gets to know more about the man he so admires he is increasingly intrigued by this hidden history. The Sensei, however, refuses to reveal anything until the third part of the book when the narrator is called away to look after his sick father and the truth is revealed in tragic circumstances, etching itself onto the narrator - and the reader's - "Kokoro" : Heart.},

Across sixteen chapters, the authors deal with issues related to labour, game development, monetization and publishing, as well as local specificities.

Game modding draws on the history of software hacking and in this respect modding can take forms that are seen as resistant or illegitimate.

However, these systems have typically focused on narratives involving only a single person. In contrast, multiplayer video games are a common and popular form of entertainment. In this paper we ask whether the way in which these works might inspire a new generation of multi-player narratives. In particular we look at the multiplayer video game "Dark Souls" and consider the goals and inter-player interactions present within the game. We then reimagine what these might look like as multi-player narratives, and demonstrate how they might be realised with a sculptural hypertext approach. We conclude that even within a single game there are a number of rich possibilities demonstrated, from asynchronous indirect examples where the players enrich each others worlds and exchange information, to synchronous direct examples where players have direct influence over the choices of other players, and thus the outcomes of their stories.},

  abstract = {This paper explores how players of Fallout 4 discuss death in response to their interactions with the game and each other. Using Atkinson and Rodgers' concept of the `murderbox', a distinction is forwarded that details player engagement in relation to explicit and implicit encounters with representations of death. Two data sources are explored using discourse analysis: the first is a player-constructed narrative charting an individual's experiences of trying to stay alive having set their own limits on survival; the second is a series of exchanges relating to the discovery of skeletons fixed in the gameworld environment. Drawing on Jenkins' work on narrative architecture, it is argued that environmental storytelling facilitates extra-narrative dialogue between players framed by reflections on the context-specific nature of mortality including the death of the avatar, emotional responses to dying at different locations in the gameworld, an interrogation of the validity of the end-of-the-world scenario and broader social death as presented in the game. In closing, the paper will argue -- with regards to notions of convergence and representation -- for a more nuanced consideration of mortality in videogames through both explicit and implicit encounters with death and dying.},

In the present research, we investigate whether we can do the same thing in an actual modern commercial video game, in this case the game Fallout 3. We stored automatic observations on 36 participants who played the introductory stages of Fallout 3. We then correlated these observations with the participants' personality profiles, expressed by values for five personality traits as measured by the standard NEO-FFI questionnaire. Our analysis shows correlations between all five personality traits and the game observations. These results validate and generalize the results from our previous research (Lankveld et al. 2011a). We may conclude that Fallout 3, and by extension other modern video games, allows players to express their personality, and can therefore be used to create personality profiles.},

  abstract = {The parallel hunting and bedroom scenes in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight have been much discussed by scholars, though the argument usually centers on Lady Bertilak's role as a hunter. Exploring the poem through the lens of game theory demonstrates that not only is Gawain a hunter, but also that the central Exchanges Game is not a game, but rather an illusion of a game. This revelation opens up a means of investigating the Anglo-Norman and Welsh roles of the landscape and characters that both facilitate such an illusion but also cause a political tension in the poem. This article contends through close readings and historiographic analysis that the reader's identification with Gawain sets up an unease by the end of the poem when the figures of Bertilak, Lady Bertilak, and Morgan La Fay are revealed as both Otherworldly and decidedly Welsh. This discomfort is a means of reacting to and interrogating Anglo-Norman appropriation of Arthuriana.},

End users respond to these attempts in unpredictable and unforeseen ways, indicating the interpretive flexibility of affordances.

Kerrigan from the StarCraft series (1998--2017) is examined as a possible counter-example, demonstrating that the monstrous-feminine can exist in a playable and potentially empowered form, though she is problematically empowered within a violent, militant framework. Overall, this article critically analyses the ways in which video games remediate tropes of gendered monstrosity and reinforce the misogynist~norms and values of hegemonic heteropatriarchal ideology by forcing players to enact symbolic violence against transgressive female bodies.},

Using the ``hag'' in Dungeons \& Dragons as a case study, the authors demonstrate how the game's bestiary, the Monster Manual, functions as a tool of patriarchal control by defining, categorizing, and classifying the body of the female other as evil, abject, and monstrous. Importantly, the ludic bestiary not only exists as a core rulebook in Dungeons \& Dragons but has also been remediated as a narrative-heavy submenu in several digital games. The authors find that the figure of the monstrous woman persists in games because of the widespread distribution of the Monster Manual to young men in hobby communities, the cultural influence of Dungeons \& Dragons, depictions of monstrosity that blend the erotic with the maternal, and the discursive categorization and objectification of the female body by ludic systems.},

  abstract = {Monstrous creatures have always been featured in fantasy games, both tabletop and digital, as enemies for the player to fight. Many of these monsters are overtly or symbolically coded as female and portrayed in ways that reinforce harmful, misogynistic ideologies. While gender representation has long been a crucial area of inquiry in game studies, few scholars have focused on the ways in which monstrosity is interwoven with issues of representation in games. With the understanding that gender representations in games can have deep cultural ramifications, especially as they intersect with representations of sexuality, queerness, body size, disability, mental illness, and age, this dissertation examines the ways that several mainstream AAA video games remediate harmful tropes of female monstrosity derived from or inspired by monsters found in mythology, folklore, fairy tales, literature, and popular culture. Utilizing a close reading methodology employing visual and textual analysis, a thorough critical examination of female monstrosity in several games was conducted focusing on visual design, narrative role, developer commentary, and player reception. Specifically, this dissertation analyzes monsters such as the succubus, siren, broodmother, banshee, harpy, hag, and crone in games which were chosen because they are considered exemplars of the roleplaying game genre, are commercially successful, and have received extensive critical acclaim.  Through an application of key theoretical concepts related to female transgression, non-normativity, and monstrosity, such as the abject, the monstrous-feminine, the femme fatale, and the grotesque, this dissertation demonstrates how mainstream games promote misogynistic beliefs via the design of female monsters and how this practice relates to the sexism that is deeply entrenched in mythology, popular culture, the game industry, and gaming culture. The conclusion from this work is that mainstream games re-entrench harmful beliefs about womens bodies and behaviours through their portrayal of female monsters and provide a symbolic enactment of gender-based violence and persecution by positioning the player as a (usually) heterosexual white male hero who must slay transgressive monstrous women in order to restore normative patriarchal order and win the game.},

However, monsters in games and play are not only entertaining but also a reflection of the monstrosity of our world. In this book, twenty-two scholars explore how themes such as mental health, colonialism, individualism, disability, gender, sexuality, racism, and exclusion are reflected in the monsters we interact with in games, play, and our daily lives both online and offline.

Interactivity is a debatable concept which has been so over-applied as to be rendered meaningless, and the sense of agency that videogame players experience is illusory. While this illusion of agency is problematic, it allows developers and players alike to engage with questions of ethics and morality. This article uses two case studies to explore different ways in which game developers have connected player agency with issues of morality. The developers of BioShock attempted to subvert notions of player agency by denying the player any meaningful control within a narrative that centralizes free will. In The Walking Dead, players are forced to make morally-heavy choices in a narrative shaped by branching and converging decision trees. While these games are enjoyable and critically acclaimed, they present the player with false choices and offer only an illusion of agency. In the end, this article argues that true player agency lies not within pre-scripted videogame narratives, but in the players' interpretations of the game text, in their engagement with fan communities, and in the exchanges that occur between fans and developers.},

This commentary provides additional critical perspectives on the concept of IGD.  Methods  The focus of this commentary is on the addiction model on which the concept of IGD is based, the nature of the DSM-5 criteria for IGD, and the inclusion of withdrawal symptoms and tolerance as the diagnostic criteria for IGD.  Results  The addiction framework on which the DSM-5 concept of IGD is based is not without problems and represents only one of multiple theoretical approaches to problematic gaming. The polythetic, non-hierarchical DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for IGD make the concept of IGD unacceptably heterogeneous. There is no support for maintaining withdrawal symptoms and tolerance as the diagnostic criteria for IGD without their substantial revision.  Conclusions The addiction model of IGD is constraining and does not contribute to a better understanding of the various patterns of problematic gaming. The corresponding diagnostic criteria need a thorough overhaul, which should be based on a model of problematic gaming that can accommodate its disparate aspects.},

The examples from four continents range from the medieval Middle East - already shaken by a convergence of ecological and social disaster - to modern imaginary constructions of medieval Vikings, the persistence of Indigenous knowledge in the Arctic, literary poetics of patrimony, and the heritage politics of Mediterranean urban architecture. Authors ask which strategies societies in developing countries use to defend their cultural and ecological uniqueness and integrity while being penetrated by environmental hazards and hegemonizing 'Western' forms of heritage culture; or how western societies construct their own past in ways that are sometimes reminiscent of traditional imaginations of a pre-modern past, petrified eternally in an 'ideal' moment of time. Colonial and historical forms of 'heritagization' of human and non-human environments, the essays show, answer to pressing emotional needs for a sense of stability. But the desire for nostalgia, frequently commodified, tends to collide with the similarly pressing need for political and economic survival in a rapidly changing world and in the face of accelerating extraction practices. Without being able to solve this dilemma, the volume makes an interdisciplinary contribution to taking intellectual stake of the asymmetrical politics and poetics of heritage and collective cultural memory.},

  abstract = {Ever since Homer told the tales of magnificent men and called these men heroes, the siren song of heroic achievement has been impossible to resist. By consistently acting in a manner that is above the capacity of normal human beings, a hero becomes a model of emulation and inspiration for ordinary, lesser mortals. This thesis traces the development of normative models of heroic thought and action in the work of Homer, Plato and Rousseau. It argues that models of heroism have evolved according to changing conceptions of the political institutions that comprise a polis and, in turn, notions of citizenship. Homer establishes the heroic ideal and offers an image of Man as Hero. The Homeric hero is a man of transparent action who is never incapacitated because he acts upon his instincts. Unrestrained by doubt, he soars above humanity and performs deeds that assure him of everlasting fame and glory. The Homeric hero is a warrior-prince who lives in the absence of a polis. He rules his community as a patriarch who places his personal quest for glory above the dictates of the common good. The Homeric hero is consequently limited in his ability to act as a model of emulation for those who live in a polis. In an historical period that gave rise to the polis as a desirable and unavoidable aspect of human life, Plato remodels heroic ideals. Thus Plato's ideals of heroism could survive and prosper alongside political structures and institutions guided by the demands of the common good. The philosophical hero exalted in the Platonic dialogues gains true knowledge, which enables him to excel at all activities he undertakes. The philosopher is impelled to channel his vast superiority into the realm of political leadership. Plato recasts the Hero as Citizen, an elite citizen who rules for the benefit of all. Plato's model of heroism, like Homer's, is premised on an anti-egalitarian, hierarchical conception of human worth. In the Social Contract, Rousseau aims to reconcile modern ideals of human equality with Homeric and Platonic hierarchical notions of heroic excellence. The Social Contract attempts to make all citizens equally heroic by insisting that men can only excel when they all participate equally in political sovereignty. Failing to reconcile heroism and equality, however, Rousseau chooses heroism and reverts firstly to aristocratic political formulas before finally abandoning politics altogether as a positive force for humanity. His work nevertheless inspired both a lasting notion of human equality that shaped the modern political landscape and evoked the romantic modern notion of an isolated individual, as epitomised by Rousseau himself, heroically climbing the peaks of human achievement. Rousseau's model of individual heroism effectively completes the cycle and returns the notion of heroism to where it begun with Homer, Man as Hero. The concept of the heroism, traced through these theorists, shows it to be a changing terrain yet consistent in its allure.},

  abstract = {The essay proposes to use alienation as a heuristic and conceptual tool for the analysis of the impact of digital information and communication technologies (ICTs) on users. It follows a historical materialist understanding, according to which data can be considered as things produced in an industrial fashion. A representational interpretation, according to which data would merely reflect a given reality, is untenable. It will be argued instead to understand data as an additional layer which has a transformative impact on reality as a whole. The analysis follows the early Marx in thinking of alienation as a structural condition which holds even if it is not experienced psychologically by users. Alienation means that the desire to express oneself and achieve social recognition, self-realization, and participation through the use of ICTs is incongruent to the inherent purposes and functions of these technologies. Digital platforms create the ideological illusion that users contribute to the production of data solely for their own gratification. Users, in turn, react to structural alienation either by internalizing it, in which case they may become enthusiastic data producers, or by imposing alienating conditions on other users. Finally, it will be shown that a strong notion of privacy is less suited to articulate concerns about the impact of ICTs because it expresses a desire for privilege and individual control which has become unfulfillable in the environment of data industries. The essay closes by showing some of the changes in institutional structures and behavior that could follow from the focus on alienation.},

Or, if there are limits to the scientific enterprise, the idea is that science, at least, sets the boundaries for what we humans can ever achieve or know about reality. There is nothing outside the domain of science, nor is there any area of human life to which science cannot successfully be applied. This view (or similar views) has sometimes been called scientism.

Board games to sports, digital games to party games, gambling to role-playing games. They all share one thing in common: rules. Indeed, rules are the one and only thing game scholars agree is central to games. But what, in fact, are rules?~In The Rule Book, Jaakko Stenros and Markus Montola explore how different kinds of rules work as building blocks of games. Rules are constraints placed on us while we play, carving a limited possibility space for us. They also inject meaning into our play: without rules there is no queen in chess, no ball in Pong, and no hole in one in golf. Stenros and Montola discuss how rules constitute games through five foundational types: the explicit statements listed in the official rules, the private limitations and goals players place on themselves, the social and cultural norms that guide gameplay, the external regulation the surrounding society places on playing, and the material embodiments of rules.~Depending on the game, rules can be formal, internal, social, external, or material. By considering the similarities and differences of wildly different games and rules within a shared theoretical framework, The Rule Book renders all games more legible.},

The soundtrack's folklorism as a stylistic musical phenomenon is also related to relevant ethnomusicological scholarship and considered within the larger cultural industry surrounding the game. In doing so, it is shown not only how The Witcher 3's musical folklorism contributes to the game's spatiotemporal aesthetics but also how creative musical intentions are transmitted, received, and mediated through the video game medium and its surrounding cultural discourses.},

  abstract = {His innovative thriller, as shocking now as when it was first published, the Penguin Classics edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Other Tales of Terror is edited with an introduction by Robert Mighall. Published as a 'shilling shocker', Robert Louis Stevenson's dark psychological fantasy gave birth to the idea of the split personality. The story of respectable Dr Jekyll's strange association with the 'damnable young man' Edward Hyde; the hunt through fog-bound London for a killer; and the final revelation of Hyde's true identity is a chilling exploration of humanity's basest capacity for evil. The other stories in this volume also testify to Stevenson's inventiveness within the Gothic tradition: 'Olalla', a tale of vampirism and tainted family blood, and 'The Body Snatcher', a gruesome fictionalisation of the exploits of the notorious Burke and Hare. This edition contains a critical introduction by Robert Mighall, which discusses class, criminality and the significance of the story's London setting. It also includes an essay on the scientific contexts of the novel and the development of the idea of the Jekyll-and-Hyde personality. Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) was born in Edinburgh, the son of a prosperous civil engineer. Although he began his career as an essayist and travel writer, the success of Treasure Island (1883) and Kidnapped (1886) established his reputation as a writer of tales of action and adventure. Stevenson's Calvinist upbringing lent him a preoccupation with predestination and a fascination with the presence of evil, themes he explored in The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886), and The Master of Ballantrae (1893). If you enjoyed The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, you might like The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, by James Hogg, also available in Penguin Classics.

  abstract = {This chapter analyses the 2010 videogame Alan Wake, a narrative based videogame that makes frequentuse of intertextuality. As well as using contemporary examples, the game also uses traditionalinternational folklore in its narrative, with the antagonist Barbara Jagger being recognisable as theRussian folk tale character Baba Yaga, for example. Using the concepts proposed and elucidated byVladimir Propp, Joseph Campbell, the chapter will first establish that the videogame offers a remediationof several traditional mythical narratives in one contemporary videogame, before going on to usethe classifications found in The Morphology of the Folktale and The Hero with a Thousand Faces toplace this videogame within the folklore and mythical tradition. It will also serve to establish whetherthese classifications are suitable for the narratives found in videogames, and if they depart from them,where the scholar needs to establish new concepts and definitions for these traditional classifications.},

In this article, I argue that by examining in more detail the phenomenological tensions between the two, we can better understand the ways in which poem-game hybrids are able to negotiate this apparent incompatibility. I propose three continuums that enable us to visualize those tensions that exist, consider what limitations are suggested by them, and discuss how the developers of what Ensslin terms `poetry games' are able to work within these limitations.},

  abstract = {This essay uses a personal account of the process of creating a videogame to explore themes of queerness, disability, and labour. I track the production of the videogame Ritual of the Moon, a game following a queer woman sent to the moon. It is played for 5 minutes per day over 28 days with choices that determine the player's unique path. The story takes up imagining the future, especially what the future looks like for queer women. Time becomes cyclical, and the fear of women with power bleeds from the past into the future, creating a future that exists between utopia and dystopia. The themes embedded in the game were experienced during production, as well: the effects of psycho-social disability (commonly labelled mental illness) on labour and art practice, queer discovery and narratives, and working through and with ``negative'' feelings. This paper intermixes theories of queer time with crip time to detail possible approaches to a queer, accessible art practice that takes seriously social inequalities yet moves towards healing. I augment Eve Sedgwick's idea of reparative reading to form a reparative art practice, one that is inclusive of the paranoid, critical, difficult, and bad feelings that are a part of queer and debilitated life.},

While this has some potential in terms of informing the public about technological development, it also makes the term a buzzword not pointing to any actual object with no agreed-upon meaning. AI is usually deployed as an umbrella term for sealing a variety of analytical tools such as intelligent decision support systems, deep learning, and computational linguistics disregarding their actual denotations. As the popular discourse and media represent its mundane features to connote miracles or apocalypses, AI gains a mythical status that can have different significations according to different cultural contexts. Our aim in this paper is to study the semantic shifts in the meaning of AI in different contexts by examining the mapping of the words to different semantic vector spaces over time.},

  abstract = {Pok\'emon is arguably one of the most enduring brands in Japanese pop culture. As of March 2014 the Pok\'emon video game franchise alone has sold more than 260 million units worldwide (Lien, 2014). The Pok\'emon series has been the most well known game that the Nintendo Game Boy series has ever produced and marketed internationally. This study looks at Pok\'emon as a cultural product. Information contained in the Pok\'edex, an electronic encyclopedia of Pok\'emon found in the game points to the use of Japanese folklore as inspiration for some of the Pok\'emon released. There is an intricate give and take in the process of telling and retelling of folktales that is argued to be present even in its currently newer forms. This study explores the digitalization of folklore by looking at the incorporation of Japanese folktales into the Pok\'emon video game. Looking at how folkloric motifs were integrated in the creation of these pocket monsters inhabiting the world of Pok\'emon points to the importance of the Japanese folklore in the character designs. These folklore motifs infused in the game characters, and the world itself gives the franchise a Japanese cultural flavor which, as pointed out by other authors like Allison, make the experience more enjoyable (2003, p. 384). As such, this study looks at how the Pok\'emon franchise fuses socio-cultural elements in the creation Pok\'emon's individual and unique pocket monsters. In effect, these new game creatures called Pok\'emon become new conduits by which old Japanese folktales are revisited, revised, and ultimately renewed. More importantly, it becomes one important avenue in the creation and proliferation of a Japanese cultural identity that is marketed abroad. It is argued that Pok\'emon is indeed a new medium where Japanese folklore has been appropriated and digitalized. According to Iwabuchi, influence of products of different cultures on everyday life cannot be culturally neutral. Instead, they inevitably carry cultural imprints called ``cultural odor.'' In terms of cultural odor, this makes Pok\'emon Japanese in fragrance. The creation of these newly formed folklore is a dynamic interaction between Japanese culture, the technology they are coursed through and gameplay as a form of performance by the consumers. The whole franchise now serves as a digital archive for folkloric beings that influenced directly or indirectly their creation. This resulted in enabling participative interaction between folklore and the individual. For international consumers, they also potentially serve as entryway into picking up an interest and learning more about Japanese culture. More than the ukiyo-e paintings and monster catalogs that proliferated during the Edo Period, Pok\'emon has fleshed out these folklore motifs and has put them at the front and center through their games, allowing for players to interact with and bond with them in an ever expanding virtual space called the Pok\'emon world.},

As these narratives progress, the depicted world is dynamically generated and visualized through Stable Diffusion, blurring the boundaries between narrative and in-game reality. This fusion of interactive storytelling combines gameplay paradigms and story together with dynamic content generation. Players not only aim to alter Shahrzad's fate from the original folklore, but also leverage the power of natural language to shape the game's world.

Players guide the LLM-driven King in co-creating narratives, with GPT-4 employing LLM reasoning methods to ensure story consistency. As these narratives progress, the depicted world is dynamically generated and visualized through Stable Diffusion, blurring the boundaries between narrative and in-game reality. This fusion of interactive storytelling combines gameplay paradigms and story together with dynamic content generation. Players not only aim to alter Shahrzad's fate from the original folklore, but also leverage the power of natural language to shape the game's world. With this example, we propose the term "AI-Native games" to categorize innovative games where GenAI is fundamental to the game's novel mechanics and very existence.},

  abstract = {This chapter examines the conceptual tensions in understanding artificial intelligence (AI) agents' role in creative processes, particularly focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon Schmidt's 1954 categorization of human-technology relationships and the classical definition of "author," this chapter proposes to understand AI agency as existing somewhere between that of an inanimate puppet and a performing actor. While AI agents demonstrate a degree of creative autonomy, including the ability to improvise and construct complex narrative content in interactive storytelling, they cannot be considered authors in the classical sense of the term. This chapter thus suggests that AI agents exist in a dynamic state between human-controlled puppets and semi-autonomous actors. This conceptual positioning reflects how AI agents, while they can certainly contribute to creative work, remain bound to human direction. We also argue that existing conceptual frames concerning authorship should evolve and adapt to capture these new relationships.},

High difficulty levels will be set if the players use good strategy and low difficulty levels will be set if the players use bad strategy. In this work, we determine the difficulties based on players' lives, enemies' health, and passive skills (skill points) that are chosen by the player. With three of these factors, players will have varies experience of playing tower defence because different combination will give different results to the system and difficulties of the games will be different for each gameplay.

I combine two methodological perspectives on the `manufacturing' of splicers by analyzing [a] the title's developer commentary and other official paratexts to trace the design of splicers, and [b] the game's embedded narrative to reconstruct the diegetic backstory of splicers. I argue that video game enemies, including splicers, are `computational others', who may appear human on the level of representation, but whose behavior is machinic, and driven by computational algorithms. To justify the paradoxical relationship between their human-like representation and machinic behavior, BioShock includes an elaborate narrative that explains how the citizens of the underwater city of Rapture were dehumanized and transformed into hostile splicers. The narrative of dehumanization, explored following Haslam's dehumanization theory (2006), includes [a] transforming splicers into atomized creatures by depriving them of political power and social bonds, [b] creating fungible and interchangeable enemies through splicers' masks and bodily disintegration, [c] justifying splicers' blindness to context and their simplistic behavior by portraying them as mentally unstable addicts. The article concludes that all video game enemies are inherently monstrous, and that critique of video game representation should focus on how games fail to make monsters human, rather than how games render humans monstrous or dehumanized.},

In Czechoslovakia at the time, there was no hardware or software market, no private enterprise, no commercial advertising and no publicly available computing or gaming magazines. Despite these limitations, a vibrant computer hobby scene emerged. Tens of thousands of Czechs and Slovaks played computer games and at least two hundred titles were developed over the course of the 1980s. Aside from playing games, Czechoslovak home computer enthusiasts were also "gaming" their hardware and software by discovering new ways to code, crack and hack. But most importantly, they looked for and took advantage of 'gaps' in the Iron Curtain and the oppressive political regime in order to play and create games.

However, it is not G\'erard Genette's original definition from 1982, but rather the expanded version proposed by Mia Consalvo in 2007 that is used in 70 percent of the 235 analyzed academic texts written in English and published between 1997 and 2019. This article provides a critical theoretical review of current paratextual scholarship and uses citation analysis to quantify the existence and impact of three different approaches to paratext: original, expanded, and reduced. In particular, the expanded framework, which is, according to the analysis, usually attributed to Consalvo, tends to be too all-encompassing by stripping away the original limitation on authorship of paratextual elements and instead resembles the screen studies term cultural epiphenomena. In the article, I highlight the differences between the three frameworks and track the frequency of their use in game studies scholarship. Additionally, I propose a methodological intervention by suggesting to avoid the reductive term ``paratext'' in the sense of a category of texts, which implies a rigid textual hierarchy. Instead I recommend treating paratextuality as a link between a text and the surrounding socio-historical reality, emphasizing that paratextuality is often accompanied by other (trans)textual qualities.},

But why is the figure of the monster so important in gaming, and how have video games come to shape our culture's conceptions of monstrosity? To answer these questions, Player vs. Monster explores the past half-century of monsters in games, from the dragons of early tabletop role-playing games and the pixelated aliens of Space Invaders to the malformed mutants of The Last of Us and the bizarre beasts of Bloodborne, and reveals the common threads among them. Covering examples from aliens to zombies, Jaroslav \v Svelch explores the art of monster design and traces its influences from mythology, visual arts, popular culture, and tabletop role-playing games. At the same time, he shows that video games follow the Cold War--era notion of clearly defined, calculable enemies, portraying monsters as figures that are irredeemably evil yet invariably vulnerable to defeat. He explains the appeal of such simplistic video game monsters, but also explores how the medium could evolve to present more nuanced depictions of monstrosity.},

Based on archival research, interviews and qualitative analyses of individual titles, it shows that entertainment was only one of the intended functions of homebrew games. Although Czechoslovak game developers were familiar with the developments in the West, they could not form a game industry due to the absence of free enterprise. They were therefore left to explore various niches of game design. Instead of providing entertainment, many computer games were used by their designers to showcase coding skills, to deliver messages to other members of the hobbyist community, or to reflect on the excesses of the Communist regime. Thanks to an efficient distribution system and a relatively low barrier of entry, computer games established themselves in the 1980s as a prominent communication medium within the Czech computer hobbyist and gaming communities.},

  abstract = {The article addresses the gap in scholarship on reception of game AI by qualitatively analysing forum discussions about the Alien monster in the game Alien: Isolation (Creative Assembly, 2014a). The game's Alien is a rare example of a recurrent, undefeatable AI-driven adversary, designed to represent a sublime monster. Its behaviour is governed by behaviour trees and simulated sensory perception (on the level of foreground AI), but also by the Director component, which monitors the global state of the game to maintain gameplay tension and periodically sends the creature near the player's location (on the level of background AI). Upon the game's release, however, very little information about its AI was disclosed. The article follows players' efforts to theorize and evaluate the game's AI, and their discussion about its (un)fairness. It outlines two basic approaches to enemy AI: experientialist, which focuses on how the opponent ``feels,'' and simulationist, which sees the monster as a simulated animal-like creature. While experientialists accept AI tricks and shortcuts, simulationists expect the Alien to be a discrete, autonomous entity, ontologically separated from its environment. The latter, for example, find it unfair that the Alien has access to information outside of its sensory perception, and seem upset by the actions of the AI Director module, which they interpret as collusion between the Alien and the game. Moreover, simulationists object to the idea that the Alien should be able to teleport or be ``tethered'' to the player character. The article points to an important paradox of AI in games. On the one hand, players welcome a degree of unpredictability, variation and mystery afforded by AI routines. On the other hand, many expect to be able to completely account for and understand the behaviour of computer-controlled opponents -- even if they are science fiction monsters.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) hold interesting potential for the design, development, and research of video games. Building on the decades of prior research on generative AI in games, many researchers have sped to investigate the power and potential of LLMs for games. Given the recent spike in LLM-related research in games, there is already a wealth of relevant research to survey. In order to capture a snapshot of the state of LLM research in games, and to help lay the foundation for future work, we carried out an initial scoping review of relevant papers published so far. In this paper, we review 76 papers published between 2022 to early 2024 on LLMs and video games, with key focus areas in game AI, game development, narrative, and game research and reviews. Our paper provides an early state of the field and lays the groundwork for future research and reviews on this topic.},

It also explores the role of gold farm studios in the business cycle. Our discussion contextualizes gold farming as a special type of fan labor through transformative gameplay enmeshed in the global game capitalist market and contributes to the understanding of China's youth-led game culture in general and the variegated intricacies of the trade of gold farming in particular.},

Tolkien\&rsquo;s writings in connection with the ideological need to demonize the enemy in World Wars I and II. Yet, in creating an enemy whom the heroes could kill without compunction, Tolkien also betrayed his own sympathy for the devils, perhaps owing to his own experiences as a soldier. This ambiguity pervades Tolkien\&rsquo;s writings, even as his demonized orcs are dispatched by the thousands, thus shaping the sense of warfare and our experience of it according to the desire to simplify, and make more comprehensible, the martial narrative.},

Yet when it comes to how we design and test games with moral dilemmas, there is little written on the subject. From this premise, The Moral Gameplay Taxonomy has been developed. Developed through an examination of 23 games, the taxonomy consists of two dimensions, creating four quadrants, which represent the different types of choices (systemic and scripted) provided to the player, and the style of endings (branching and linear). As this is a preliminary study, further work needs to be undertaken to develop the taxonomy further. It will be a valuable tool for examining how the design of moral dilemmas can affect player perceived agency and enjoyment in games.},

Through investigation of the members of the community of those who design and use UI modifications for WoW, we gather information that may aid in the creation of communities dedicated to modifying the interfaces of other software packages. The goal of this paper is to study the effect that user created interfaces have had on WoW and its community of users. To achieve this goal, we issued an online survey to WoW players that investigated four aspects of the community: (R1) the backgrounds of its members, (R2) their attitudes towards modifications and the community itself, (R3) their use of UI modifications, (R4) the characteristics and motivations of users who create and share modifications. The survey results represented numerous unique viewpoints and shed light on the varied nature of the UIM community of those who design and use WoW modifications. The results suggest that the interface of a videogame is best developed in concert with its players via UI modifications because the users of the system may be the best equipped to design or customize the interface to meet their needs. Since every user may have unique ideas about the perfect interface for a software package, perhaps the only way one could ever satisfy all users is to give them the ability to create their own.},

The emergence of Old School RuneScape in 2013 also offers a chance to reflect on how constructs of nostalgia can emerge in contemporary media, and how we might consider player relationships to games with iterative development such as RuneScape as being centered in nostalgia, and also as a form of retrofuturism.},

SpaceX's messaging engages in a second-order appropriation of entwined Christian, colonial, frontierist, and imperialist themes that saturate works of astrocolonial science fiction. Musk and many of his followers are devoted fans of these works and draw inspiration from their endemic romanticized, utopian, space expansionist narratives in order to fuel the project of Mars colonization. In deploying popular marketing techniques, such as ``manufactured urgency,'' ``perceived obsolescence,'' ``scarcity marketing,'' ``exploding offers,'' and ``argument dilution,'' Musk prophetically stresses the existential urgency of planetary exodus. As Mars gets rebranded as ``Earth 2.0,'' the strategic use of apocalyptic ``Mars as New Earth'' visual and verbal rhetoric activates troubling dynamics that effectively legitimize siphoning off Earth's remaining fragile resources in order to feed the colonial and corporate interests of a technocratic billionaire elite. This article dissects the religio-cultural providential resonances of otherworldly escape and manifest destiny evoked in Mars colonization marketing, while urging public media interventions into that marketing's grossly misleading messaging.}

Rather than viewing these inequalities as merely incidental to the professionalization\&nbsp;of competitive gaming, particularly in North America, I argue that esports arose as a response to the threat of greater gender-based equity in gaming cultures. Esports does not have a gender problem; it\&nbsp;is a gender problem.\&nbsp;This article connects three historical transformations in the history of professionalized spectator sports in order to constitute a media genealogy of esports and a prehistory of its gender troubles. Through a series of vignettes---a late nineteenth-century boxing match, a mid-twentieth-century football game, and a 2008 esports tournament---I trace the development of ``kinaesthetic masculinity'': the capacity for masculine subjects to feel a sense of belonging, by virtue of broadcasting media techniques and infrastructures, to aestheticized (and most often violent) competition between men.\&nbsp;},

  abstract = {Not of Woman Born combines an examination of the structure and genre of horror within video games to analyze how horror video games operate and the significance of those workings to video games and digital media, horror across media types, Gothic literature, and gender. The majority of texts on games---like Espen Aarseth's Cybertext and Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman's Rules of Play---have focused on founding the overall methods by which games operate, either in terms of other media forms or solely within games and new media. Not of Woman Born focuses on the particularities of horror games to illustrate commonalities in video games, and to illustrate how certain conventions fail or can be subverted in order to produce particular effects. Running through the chapters is an awareness of games and their current placement as mass-conglomerated media, even as games repeatedly diverge into alternative projects like independent and political games and movements like the Serious Games Initiative and the Games for Health projects. Not of Woman Born configures game and new media studies in such a way that gender studies and studies of Gothic literature expose the function of horror in/by video games, the relationship of gaming norms to that function, and the significance of horror games to typical and atypical video game playing and production---from the typical technological improvements leading to improved graphical realism to the atypical and more complex connection among technology, design, and production. Essentially, Not of Woman Born serves as a foil to the structuralist studies by studying abnormal play and design, including the relevance of atypical design and play to innovative design for positive or more equivocal gender representations and for larger possibilities in game design. The Gothic functions as a series of monstrous becomings, and it is within these becomings that this study operates---monstrosities made in the interface, the visual representations, the narratives, and in the technologies of horror games.},

Examining the transformations the camera enacted, both to the practice of ethnographic fieldwork and to participants' embodied performances of competitive gaming, this article explores the central role played by recording technologies in the production of e-sports. It concludes by considering some of the intersections of surveillance, gaming, and emergent leisure practices -- including the use of digital recording technologies to collect social scientific data, at a time when watching and being watched is increasingly pervasive, pleasurable, and problematic.},

  abstract = {Much of the current critical and theoretical literature on new media, including video and computer games, assumes both the conceptual transparency of the video or computer screen and the absolute authority of a rational scientific order.[1] In keeping with these cultural prejudices, descriptions of the optical space of video games presume an uncomplicated optical scheme, founded on traditions of linear perspective. This can be seen with game designers, and game critics, treatment of video game perspective and point-of-view: video game spaces are understood to be the procedural outcomes of geometrically articulated orders derived from using program code and the physics of game engines.[2] But, video game spaces are more than simply the sum of their code -- they are experiential spaces generated through code and the player's interaction with the execution of that code through the medium of the screen. Given this multifaceted experiential component of games, an uncritical conception of spatial phenomenology and the verisimilitude of linear perspective fails to explain how video games operate. Critical theory, theory which explains how the player operates both on the game space and within the game space, is needed. In this paper, I propose that the models of subjectivity and agency offered by psychoanalysis provide a way to investigate the relationship of the player, player-character and the screen. For this investigation, I specifically examine how perspective shapes the field of the gaze and the implications of that shaping.},

  abstract = {Experimental evidence has pointed toward a negative effect of violent video games on social behavior. Given that the availability and presence of video games is pervasive, negative effects from playing them have potentially large implications for public policy. It is, therefore, important that violent video game effects are thoroughly and experimentally explored, with the current experiment focusing on prosocial behavior. 120 undergraduate volunteers (Mage = 19.01, 87.5\% male) played an ultra-violent, violent, or non-violent video game and were then assessed on two distinct measures of prosocial behavior: how much they donated to a charity and how difficult they set a task for an ostensible participant. It was hypothesized that participants playing the ultra-violent games would show the least prosocial behavior and those playing the non-violent game would show the most. These hypotheses were not supported, with participants responding in similar ways, regardless of the type of game played. While null effects are difficult to interpret, samples of this nature (undergraduate volunteers, high male skew) may be problematic, and participants were possibly sensitive to the hypothesis at some level, this experiment adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that violent video game effects are less clear than initially thought.},

El \'exito de videojuegos considerados hardcore como Dark Souls, los g\'eneros roguelike y metroidvania o el fumblecore, esos videojuegos con controles complicados y torpes, son solo una peque\~na muestra de c\'omo entendemos la dificultad. La dificultad en el videojuego ha sido y es una herramienta legitimadora tanto de la calidad de un videojuego como del jugador capaz de dominarlo. Si es dif\'icil es mejor, nos decimos. Forma parte de la historia del medio desde sus inicios en los salones recreativos, un modelo de juego cl\'asico caracterizado por ofrecer un abanico de estilos de juego escaso y sencillo de comprender, con objetivos expl\'icitos y castigos severos. Pero el lenguaje del videojuego era m\'as amplio ya en sus inicios, con g\'eneros como la aventura textual, y ha evolucionado tambi\'en hacia otros terrenos, con una multiplicidad de propuestas que nos obligan a entender la dificultad como resistencia del juego al jugador. Es una cuesti\'on, tambi\'en, de envolturas. No nos podemos cerrar a entenderla \'unicamente desde la dimensi\'on mec\'anica que afecta a la habilidad del jugador para afrontar retos. Debemos incorporar la exploraci\'on de narrativas puzle, tem\'aticas complejas, densidad atmosf\'erica, emociones negativas, implicaci\'on emocional, referencias filos\'oficas o reflexiones pol\'iticas, as\'i como la condici\'on personal y experiencial del videojuego, para entender la dificultad en toda su complejidad l\'udica y expresiva. La dificultad atraviesa toda la experiencia de juego, afectada por m\'ultiples factores mec\'anicos, ficcionales y de la propia actuaci\'on del jugador. Este libro aborda la experiencia de la dificultad desde la est\'etica, usando una perspectiva amplia en la que tienen cabida tanto la dimensi\'on mec\'anica del juego como la ficcional (la narrativa, el arte o las tem\'aticas), as\'i como tambi\'en el relevante papel del jugador en la experiencia personal. Con una introducci\'on te\'orica que ayuda a situar la dificultad en el mapa de lo complejo, este libro propone treinta motivos ludoficcionales como herramientas de an\'alisis est\'etico que ayudar\'an a entender mejor c\'omo y por qu\'e nos enfrentamos a (y disfrutamos) lo dif\'icil.},

In doing so, this chapter highlights the emergence of a hybrid ludo-narrative form within the Gothic genre, and examines the ways in which the series presents said narratives to the player as it shifts the onus of narrative engagement from the storyteller to the one now living the experience. The chapter explores video-ludic interpretations of death, play, and experientiality through the lens of video game studies, and posits the value of the series as a defining moment in the Japanese action role-playing game genre.},

On top of the classic ``easy to learn, hard to master'' arcade games, the development of the domestic market saw the rise of more expansive and varied game worlds, in computer RPGs or adventure games. This added complexity is often synonym with a more steep difficulty curve due to the amount of information to assimilate early on. In this paper, we will try to understand how game designers have organised the challenge and complexity of their games through the development of assistance systems: tutorials, check points, adjustable difficulty, etc. The historical evolution of these systems supposes a major change in the way players are addressed by the medium, from the highly competitive environment of early days to the seemingly more cooperative attitude of contemporary games.},

Using a qualitative and exploratory design, blogs posted between March 2012 and January 2013 were analyzed for content describing experiences via gameplay that members reported made them feel more resilient. Both social and emotional aspects of resilience were discussed with players reporting game experiences had helped them feel more confident in their abilities. Many also associated themselves with the same resilient traits as their characters display in games. A range of popular off-the-shelf video games were reported as helpful in providing players with the opportunity to feel confident under pressure and, importantly, some players reported transferring these positive psychological effects to their real-world lives.},

This participatory aesthetic is structured by a set of temporal concerns: A past made ever more available through information technology and yet ever more materially irrecoverable, a present subject to increasingly rapid change and therefore briefer and more difficult to interpret, and a bleak future of inevitable capitalist commodification. Within this temporal vortex, Gibson's protagonist finds compensatory solace in her ability to see patterns and thus develop strategies by which to value objects and people in new ways. She learns how to care, and what to care for. From this analysis of Pattern Recognition, the essay tracks this aesthetic into Guerrilla Games' 2017 Horizon: Zero Dawn---a popular entry in a medium that promises participatory involvement on a new scale.},

Individual myths function differently depending on cultural practice, religious context or literary tradition, and this interdisciplinary study merges new perspectives in Plato studies with recent scholarship and theories pertaining to myth. Significant overlaps exist between prominent modern theories of myth and attitudes and approaches in studies of Plato's myths. Considering recent developments in myth studies, this book asks new questions about the evaluation of myth in Plato. Its appreciation of the historical conditions shaping and directing the study of Plato's myths opens deeper philosophical questions about the relationship between philosophy and myth and the relevance of myth studies to philosophical debates. It also extends the discussion to address philosophical questions and perspectives on the distinction between argument and narrative},

  abstract = {Since its release in 2004, World of Warcraft (WoW) has regularly changed the game and the play experience in signifi cant ways. Recently, Blizzard, the developer of WoW, announced the upcoming game WoW Classic: ``an authentic, Blizzard-quality classic experience''. Drawing on interviews with adult WoW fans and gamers, the article examines the game as an `aff ective space' (Hills, 2002) of fandom that cannot be separated from the fan narratives and experiences it mediates. A key component in this aff ective space is the notion of fan nostalgia. The nostalgic relationship between a fan and a favourite text is often imbued with an imagined history, conjoining aff ect and meaning, belief and knowledge, and making nostalgia ``both a way of knowing worlds -- and a discourse of knowledge'' (Radstone, 2010, p. 188). The article traces diff erent and often contradictory modes of fan nostalgia connected to WoW, such as tactile feelings of technostalgia (Bolin, 2015), deeply personal and anchoring types of nostalgia in the form of totemic objects (Proctor, 2017), manifested through fan practices of collecting digital items and souvenirs (Geraghty, 2014), and interwoven with desirable and appropriate self-identity and self-narrative (Williams, 2014). In reading these modes of nostalgia, the article argues that they ultimately function as a sort of `homecoming', as the gamers' many different experiences of the game and media texts surrounding the game all come together as complex attempts of memory work, creating the possibility of establishing a home within their fandom.},

Such manufactured tropes are traditionally considered outside the purview of academic folklore study, but the folkloresque offers a frame for understanding them that is grounded in the discourse and theory of the discipline.  Fantasy fiction, comic books, anime, video games, literature, professional storytelling and comedy, and even popular science writing all commonly incorporate elements from tradition or draw on basic folklore genres to inform their structure.

  abstract = {A new expanded edition of Tolkien's most famous, and most important essay, which defined his conception of fantasy as a literary form, and which led to the writing of The Lord of the Rings. Accompanied by a critical study of the history and writing of the text. J.R.R. Tolkien's "On Fairy-stories" is his most-studied and most-quoted essay, an exemplary personal statement of his views on the role of imagination in literature, and an intellectual tour de force vital for understanding Tolkien's achievement in the writing of The Lord of the Rings. "On Fairy-stories" comprises about 18,000 words. What is little-known is that when Tolkien expanded the essay in 1943, he wrote many more pages of his views that were originally condensed into or cut from the published version. An estimate is difficult, but these unpublished passages perhaps amount to half again as much writing as the essay itself. These passages contain important elaborations of his views on other writers, and their publication represents a significant addition to Tolkien studies. Included in this new critical study of the work are: * An introductory essay setting the stage for Tolkien's 1939 lecture (the origin of the essay) and placing it within a historical context. * A history of the writing of 'On Fairy-stories', beginning with coverage of the original lecture as delivered, and continuing through to first publication in 1947. * The essay proper as published in corrected form in Tree and Leaf (1964). * Commentary on the allusions in the text, and notes about the revisions Tolkien made to the text as published in Tree and Leaf. * Important material not included in the essay as published, with commentary by the editors. Contained within "On Fairy-stories" are the roots of the tree of tales that bore such glittering fruit in Tolkien's published and unpublished work. Here, at last, Flieger and Anderson reveal through literary archaeology the extraordinary genesis of this seminal work and discuss, in their engaging commentary, how what Tolkien discovered during the writing of the essay would shape his writing for the rest of his life.},

Readonly map interfaces enable players to consume maps, which is sufficient for wayfinding. Game cartography interfaces enable players to persistentlymodifymaps, expanding the range of activity to support planning and coordination. We employ thematic analysis on game cartography interfaces, contributing a near-exhaustive catalog of games featuring such interfaces, a set of properties to describe and design such interfaces, a collection of play activities that relate to cartography, and a framework to identify what properties promote the activities. We expect that designers will find the contributions enable them to promote desired play experiences through game map interface design.},

Taking an actor-centered approach, this article draws on in-depth interviews that are analyzed through a cgt-framework. Attention is paid to how different social media `bubbles' and platform-specific affordances and vernaculars impact the responses the women receive and their possibilities of reacting thereto as their content moves between different platforms beyond their control. The results are discussed against the background of theories of agency in the context of gender, religion, and digital media, arguing for an understanding of agency as relational, situated, and dispersed.},

In opposition to this position, some claim that this approach denies player subjectivity by ignoring the dynamic, culturally-embedded ways in which players create, rather than receive, meaning through play. This paper clarifies the proceduralist position by exploring a notion of the procedural that necessarily includes the individual player as part of a circuit in which a computational machine is able to operate meaningfully. From this point, procedural rhetoric is reframed in the language of semiotics to demonstrate that the proceduralist position respects player autonomy and expects meaning to result from the harmonious alignment between the authorial sign system and the many cultural sign systems within which the player is embedded.},

Interpreting BurgerTime provided a challenge to the proceduralist perspective that required investigating its outer limits and assumptions. In the end, a comprehensive reading is achieved by considering the gameplay of expert players: those who understand the rules of a game the most.},

These representations are rooted in the affordances of the video game medium, meaning that even as Dark Souls comments on real religion it also comes up against the limits and particularities of its own form. I argue this case with reference to three aspects of fictive religion found in Dark Souls: religious architecture, religious violence, and religious sacrifice. Individually, none of these aspects are exclusively religious. Architecture and violence exist outside of religion, and so does sacrifice, taken in a broad sense. Thus for Dark Souls real religion is not treated as existing in some sealed vacuum isolated from other areas of human life. It has cultural, political, and economic dimensions, and part of the commentary offered by Dark Souls examines those interconnections. A study of Dark Souls thus informs our understanding of the capacity of video games to engage meaningfully with topics such as religion, as well as perhaps suggesting certain structural similarities between religion and video games.},

  abstract = {Online Collectible Card Games (OCCGs) are enormously popular worldwide. Previous studies found that the social aspects of physical CCGs are crucial for players' motivation and engagement. We know little about the different types of sociability that OCCGs afford. This study aims to identify social design features that may affect players' sense of social presence and motivation. It will also investigate how these features and social structures impact players' wellness and sense of community in an eSport center on a university campus. We will:1) identify social design features of popular OCCGs and organize them into different categories of sociability; 2) conduct a large scale online survey on OCCG forums to investigate their effects on players' motivation; 3) periodically survey and interview Hearthstone players at QUT eSports for six months to examine the role of social features of OCCGs on participants' wellbeing and community formation on campus. The results of this study will not only help us understand why OCCGs are very popular but also can be used to inform best practices and principles in OCCGs, as well as investigate community building benefits of OCCGs at a university campus1.},

Despite their popularity and unique mechanics, we know very little about OCCG players, their motivations and play habits. A survey study using the Trojan player typology[11] with 856 players from two popular OCCGs (Hearthstone and Eternal) revealed four main player motivations: immersion seeker, socializer, competition and smarty-pants. Competition and immersion seeking were main motivations to play OCCGs whereas socializing and strategizing (smarty-pants) were the least. These differ from the findings with CCGs where the main motivations were socialization and strategy development. We found Eternal players had higher satisfaction of their autonomy and competence needs than Hearthstone players. These findings contribute to our understanding of why individuals play different types of video games. It also helps game designers to target the needs and motivations of their audience.},

Arguably the finest edged weapon ever made, combining a lethal cutting edge with a flexible and resilient core, a fine katana is as much a work of art as a deadly weapon. For centuries it was also the defining icon of the samurai, as it was above all the possession of a katana that identified those belonging to Japan's warrior class. This book explores the astonishing craftsmanship that gave the katana its particular qualities, as well as the swordsmanship of famous samurai and great masters, and recounts dramatic tales of the katana's use -- from private duels and revenge killings to its role in full-scale samurai warfare.},

However, it remains unclear how SDT has advanced HCI games research, or how HCI games scholars engage with the theory. We reviewed 110 CHI and CHI PLAY papers that cited SDT to gain a better understanding of the ways the theory has contributed to HCI games research. We find that SDT, and in particular, the concepts of need satisfaction and intrinsic motivation, have been widely applied to analyse the player experience and inform game design. Despite the popularity of SDT-based measures, however, prominent core concepts and mini-theories are rarely considered explicitly, and few papers engage with SDT beyond descriptive accounts. We highlight conceptual gaps at the intersection of SDT and HCI games research, and identify opportunities for SDT propositions, concepts, and measures to more productively inform future work.},

The book utilizes a number of high-profile and in-depth case studies - including 'chavs', asylum seekers, Gypsies and Travellers, and the 2011 London riots - to examine the ways in which individuals negotiate restrictive neoliberal ideologies of selfhood. In doing so, Tyler argues for a deeper psychosocial understanding of the role of representational forms in producing marginality, social exclusion and injustice, whilst also detailing how stigmatization and scapegoating are resisted through a variety of aesthetic and political strategies. Imaginative and original, Revolting Subjects introduces a range of new insights into neoliberal societies, and will be essential reading for those concerned about widening inequalities, growing social unrest and social justice in the wider global context."--Publisher's website},

  abstract = {This paper aims to develop new co-design techniques for narrative design from scratch in the digital game design process with children. Designing from scratch requires the plain preferences of children and creativity (creative contributions) from their intrinsic drives. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and leverage ``children's imagination''. To trigger children's imagination, we proposed three novel approaches to develop new co-design techniques that are based on (1) game elements, (2) narrative models, and (3) Philosophy for Children (P4C). Using these approaches, narrative design processes for digital games were performed by an intergenerational design team that included eight children aged 7--11. Children played the role of design partners in the participatory design setting. Data analysis was performed using an analysis framework with two domains: co-design process (implementation, involvement of children, and involvement of adults) and game narrative design (involvement of children and product features). The first technique, Five Elements, was based on game elements and had many strengths in game narrative design and the involvement of children and adults. There are some challenges in implementation because it requires a substantial time commitment, it is not easy to allocate adult team members, and it is difficult to arrange the environment. The second technique, Game Motif, was based on narrative models and had many strengths in all of the criteria, except variety in game genres, which is related to product features. The third technique, Superhero Enquiry, was based on P4C and had limited strengths, including the involvement of children in the co-design process and game narrative design. This paper indicates the strengths and challenges of the new techniques and presents the techniques themselves. It offers some improvements to use these approaches in more effective ways. Consequently, academia and industry can benefit greatly from the contributions of children's imagination when designing digital games for children using these new techniques appropriately in a given context. \copyright{} 2021},

Sederholm and Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock's The Age of Lovecraft as a starting-point. The assumption is that the two `ages' are historically and thematically linked through the `monsters' that inhabit them; monsters that include---but are not limited to---extensions, reproductions, and evolutions of Lovecraft's writings. Preoccupied with environmental issues such as global climate change, the twenty-first-century imaginary has conjured monsters that appear to have much in common with early twentieth-century cosmic horror stories. Considering the renewed interest in Lovecraft and the weird, such developments raise the question: What can (weird) monsters tell us about the Anthropocene moment? This paper maps the `monstrous' in the discourses emerging from the Anthropocene epoch and `The Age of Lovecraft' by considering (new) weird narratives from contemporary literature, graphic novels, film, TV, and video games. Mindful of on-going discussions within ecocriticism, philosophy, and critical theory, the paper discusses a handful of unconventional texts to investigate the potential of the weird for expressing Anthropocene anxieties and for approaching nonhuman realities from new angles.},

These practices share the tacit presupposition that there cannot be genuine political debate about facts, because facts are unambiguous and not subject to interpretation. Therefore, when the black-and-white facts---as they appear to the fact checkers---conflict with the claims produced by politicians, the fact checkers are able to see only (to one degree or another) ``lies.'' The examples of dubious fact-checking practices that we discuss show the untenability of the na\"ive political epistemology at work in the fact-checking branch of journalism. They may also call into question the same epistemology in journalism at large, and in politics.},

The Western landscape, the intersection between geographical space and the viewers' gaze, was configured following the different ways of understanding the world throughout history. Interpreting these realities from a twenty first century perspective allows us to redefine the stages in the perception of the landscape and place them in context. Based on the binary nature-reason, this paper builds a historical narrative that highlights the most representative moments in landscape perception, those which constitute a paradigm shift. Understanding the consequences of this evolution, enables us to outline some ideas that might indicate a direction of the future.},

Our review of framing the enemy gleans perspectives from multiple disciplines including International Relations, political communication, and digital gaming. Our empirical analysis traces the evolution of images in digital games from 2001 to 2013 to reveal the identity of the enemies and protagonists and to examine the context of the game -- including the setting where each game takes place. We find that Russians are a popular form of enemy in FPS games even after considering terrorists as a broad category. Our review of the literature and our empirical analysis together present a foundation for the future study of digital games as a process of framing of enemies and transmission of threats.},

  abstract = {In an age dominated by media, religion has been assumed to be resurging, albeit in different forms. This study hypothesises that the massively multiplayer online role-playing (MMORPG) video game World of Warcraft, with its powerful ludic, narrative and fantasy features, is a significant aspect of cultural changes, including the religious. Within the framework of a functional definition of religion, this study uses textual analysis to investigate the place of the traditionally identified three major elements of religion namely, myth, ritual and community in constructing what may be understood as a cohesive religious environment in World of Warcraft. The textual data is supplemented by an exploration of the game-playing experiences and religious perspectives of players of World of Warcraft in India and gives added richness to the text. From a cultural perspective, the study identifies how a postmodern generation can construct meaning from virtual worlds like World of Warcraft that transcends some mundane aspects of their life. The study proposes a fresh outlook into how social researchers can look at notions such as religion, whose central ideas revolve around the metaphysical and super-natural, by exploring the boundaries of actual and virtual, of seriousness and play, and of sacred and secular within a technologically constructed fantasy digital game. Further, it explores whether the gamers themselves -- individually or collectively -- see the MMORPG environment of WoW as having religious characteristics that contribute to their search for transcendence and meaning. Finally, the study considers the implications this has for thinking about the relationship between new media and changes in social religiosity and the re-culturation of religion in a postmodern media context.},

Genetic criticism is an approach to the study of textual works that specifically analyses the production process of these works, and the different versions the work took on during its creation. I argue that similarly approaching digital games as fluid, coded artefacts is a useful strategy for game analysis. As digital games inherently contain different versions of themselves, including translations and cut content, they form an ideal object of study for genetic critics. In the last part of this paper, I illustrate how a kind of ``folk genetic game criticism'' is already fruitfully being performed, with specific reference to YouTuber Lance McDonald's investigations of alpha versions of Dark Souls III.},

Perceived realism is understood as a multidimensional concept, going beyond the more traditional use of `realism' in historical game studies, where it often refers to the plausibility or accuracy of historical reconstructions. The study further examines how perceived realism relates to players' enjoyment of historical games. Specifically, this study analyses Assassin's Creed, Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Through an online survey among 1,317 respondents, this study found that the five-dimensional structure of perceived realism holds for historical games. The three games differed in their perceptions of social realism, perceptual pervasiveness, freedom of choice and enjoyment. Finally, perceptual pervasiveness and character involvement were identified as strong predictors of enjoyment in historical games. This study contributes towards further validation of the perceived realism scale across game genres and pleads for a systematic use of the multidimensional term `realism' in historical game research.},

The present article investigates how these insights may be applied to mythological video games (i.e. those that represent and simulate a storyworld known from or inspired by mythological traditions). Specifically, this article argues (1) that through the collection, combination, and presentation of different myths, mythological video games often exhibit characteristics similar to ancient and modern mythography, (2) that on the basis of these mythographical qualities, they may be considered as interactive mythology museums, and (3) that the incorporation of these features has potential for applications in education. As case studies, this article considers the popular games Age of Mythology, Smite, Immortals Fenyx Rising, God of War (and its sequel, God of War: Ragnar\"ok), Apotheon, and Hades in light of their mythographical and museal properties. Finally, several future directions to further improve upon the educational potential of these games for both formal and informal learning are suggested.},

Players randomly confront one another in a notoriously difficult and unforgiving game space that requires commitment and perseverance. The game, it is shown, provides a metaphor for online surveillance mechanics in which players/netizens are not just democratically gazing at each other but subjected to a procedural system determining who can see whom.

  abstract = {The article focuses on the underlying structures evaluating acts of violence against different bodies in games. Taking the hunting mechanics of open-world games as its point of discussion, it looks at how game design manifests procedural arguments on the ideological aspects of animal violence. Whereas there are instances of explicit violence in these games, the article argues that the explicitness of such depictions serves to emphasize the ``messiness'' of producing animal goods, thus impeding the ``carnist'' ideological view of meat as pure commodity. By considering how games distinguish humans from animals, it looks at what violent acts are rendered acceptable or unacceptable, and notes distinctions between what bodies are protected by, or exempt from, moral and legal rights.Finally, the article considers how the algorithmic nature of spawning makes digital animals immune to extinction. Interestingly enough, the article nevertheless notices how a game may intentionally diverge from this logic in order to defamiliarize its established logic.Among the games discussed are Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption (2010), and Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed III (2012) and Far Cry 3 (2012).},

We agree that there are some people whose play of video games is related to life problems. We believe that understanding this population and the nature and severity of the problems they experience should be a focus area for future research. However, moving from research construct to formal disorder requires a much stronger evidence base than we currently have. The burden of evidence and the clinical utility should be extremely high, because there is a genuine risk of abuse of diagnoses. We provide suggestions about the level of evidence that might be required: transparent and preregistered studies, a better demarcation of the subject area that includes a rationale for focusing on gaming particularly versus a more general behavioral addictions concept, the exploration of non-addiction approaches, and the unbiased exploration of clinical approaches that treat potentially underlying issues, such as depressive mood or social anxiety first. We acknowledge there could be benefits to formalizing gaming disorder, many of which were highlighted by colleagues in their commentaries, but we think they do not yet outweigh the wider societal and public health risks involved. Given the gravity of diagnostic classification and its wider societal impact, we urge our colleagues at the WHO to err on the side of caution for now and postpone the formalization.},

Capitalism's twin pillars - markets and profit - have been replaced with big tech's platforms and rents. Meanwhile, with every click and scroll, we labour like serfs to increase its power. Welcome to technofeudalism.

As higher education sees continuing turbulence overlap with a strengthening of student engagement, this systematic literature review reappraises how students as `citizens' are enabled to shape their learning. It does so in a Scottish tertiary context and through the prism of Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation, a classic framework whose eight rungs present a spectrum of ways that stakeholders can be engaged in decisions. The article explores the use of the ladder over half a century in planning, housing, health, schools and, finally, higher education, analysing critiques and adaptations of the ladder, conducting meta-synthesis across the literature to extract conclusions for student engagement. It concludes that Arnstein's ladder has continuing value to conversations about partnership in tertiary education, and that the centrality of power to both the ladder and student engagement in a sector and wider world of increasing democratic citizenship presents a challenge to decision-makers. These conclusions, and the study's limitations, point to further research opportunities that could enhance the understanding of engagement and partnership at a time of change and uncertainty.},

We argue (a) that games offer a meaningful social experience, (b) that this sociality flourishes due to the perceived lack of social risk particularly due to OSG characteristics of perceived or real anonymity, (c) that this works to facilitate social development, and (d) that these characteristics were valuable in the context of a pandemic at a time of reduced social interaction.

The paper will argue that the player's relation to a game, in contrast to the aesthetic relation as theorised in post-Kantian aesthetics, invokes an active, purposive disposition -- and, moreover, that it is this active, purposive disposition itself that is brought forth into presentation by the ludic work. The conclusion reached is that the ludic aesthetic work establishes a gameworld as a sphere of existential praxis for the player, within which she lives a being-in-the-gameworld, which, in being inscribed into the unity of the game as an object distinct from the player, is itself externalised as an object of her aesthetic contemplation.},

  abstract = {It is a defining quality of the category of games fitting under the label of the `figure game' that they not only establish a world to be explored and experienced, but also a subjective identity for the player to inhabit in relation to this world. It is this subjective identity within the gameworld, termed the ludic subject, that this dissertation takes as its focus. The question this dissertation sets out to answer is: What is the nature of the `I' that exists as a subject in relation to the experiential world established by the game? The investigative approach that shall be adopted with regard to the question of subjectivity is that of phenomenology. A twofold understanding of subjectivity is drawn upon -- both as the `subject' of experience in its first-personal givenness, and as the objectified `self' that emerges in a second-order act of reflection upon first-order subjective experience. With regard to the ludic subject, these two dimensions of subjectivity are integrated in the development of a double perspectival structure of ludic experience, by which the player inhabits both a perspective internal to the gameworld as the ludic subject, and a perspective external to the gameworld, which frames the ludic subject as an object of perception. This twofold understanding provides the structure for the two-part claim this dissertation makes with regard to ludic subjectivity. Firstly, the player's involvement with the gameworld through incorporation in the form of a playable figure (containing within it the senses of both `avatar' and `character') reflects the experiential and existential structures of embodied being-in-the-world. Secondly, the capture and representation of this ludic subjectivity within the frame of the game as a textual unity sets in motion an aesthetics of subjectivity, by which the player's own in-game `I' is offered back to her as a represented ludic self. In addressing these dimensions of the ludic subject, this dissertation, firstly, engages in an analysis of the formal mechanisms by which the player is located within a specific ludic subject-position in relation to the gameworld, and is thereby determined as a ludic subject. The phenomenological investigations of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty are brought to bear upon this stage of the investigation. Secondly, this dissertation interrogates the nature of the ludic self that is enacted in the player's engagement with the gameworld from the standpoint of the ludic subject-position, that the player identifies as `I' within the gameworld. Here, the notion of a narrative self developed by Ricoeur and Zahavi is integrated with a literary-theoretical approach to character as a means of conceptualizing the ludic self as it is constructed textually through the game's representation of the player's actions and experiences as a ludic subject in the gameworld. Thirdly, on this basis, the dissertation maps out the web of relations -- of identity and difference, proximity and distance, selfhood and otherness -- that play out across the gap between the player outside the game and the ludic subject in the game, and which represent a formally-enshrined foregrounding of the experiential structures of subjectivity and selfhood.},

This paper argues that these discourses align with what Jacques Ranci\`ere termed the ``representative regime'' of art, and that, instead, much can be gained by adopting the perspective of the ``aesthetic regime'', which considers the artwork not as an objective system or logos, but as an object of thought for its recipient. Such an understanding allows us to align the philosophical aesthetics of Kant, Ingarden and Iser with preliminary work done in the field of game hermeneutics, with Arsenault and Perron's concept of the ``magic cycle'' of game play, and with a phenomenological approach to the game object. This will let us theorize games as aesthetic objects, mental constructs developed by the player as she engages with the unseen game system --- which, in turn, allows us to suggests that what may be called the ``ludic sublime'' is a crucial aesthetic moment in the player's engagement with a game, defined by the player's drive towards mastery of the game coming face-to-face with the impossibility of obtaining complete, direct knowledge of the underlying system. Finally, the concept of the ludic sublime, and its aesthetic implications, will be framed through an analysis of Dark Souls that will demonstrate the aesthetic mechanisms of the ludic sublime in action.},

In the two major, foundational works of aesthetic philosophy in late eighteenth-century German idealism -- Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment (2007[1790]) and Friedrich Schiller's Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man (2016[1795]), the aesthetic -- as a category of judgments, as a disposition, as a mode of being -- is inextricably intertwined with the notion of play. Still, if it is in play itself -- and, more specifically, play as it is manifested in the form of games, that is, in game play -- that our interest lies, then it is instructive to follow the lines of reasoning developed by Kant and Schiller in the reverse direction, and consider play in the light of the use to which the concept is put in their aesthetic systems, in particular as it stands in close relation to the concepts of beauty and freedom. It shall be my claim in this paper that paying close attention to the aesthetic concept of play that is developed in Kant and Schiller will reveal that the concept remains current, serving as a precursor to, and enduring as the foundation for, later philosophical approaches to play: specifically, those of Jean-Paul Sartre (1966[1943]) and Eugen Fink (2015[[1960]), as well as continuing to inform contemporary approaches to the study of game play.},

  abstract = {When game studies has tackled the player-character, it has tended to do so by means of an opposition to the notion of the avatar, with the result that the ontological and semiotic nature of the character in itself has not been given due attention. This paper draws on understandings of character from the fields of narratology and literary theory to highlight the double-layered ontology of character as both a possible individual and as a semiotic construction. Uri Margolin's narratological model of character signification is used as the basis for developing a semiotic-structural model of the player-character that addresses its specific medialities and formal nature -- a task which is performed through illustrative close examinations of the player-characters in The Last of Us (Naughty Dog 2013) and Gone Home (The Fullbright Company 2013), contextualized by means of comparative references to a wide range of player-characters in a variety of games.},

I climbed the hill, straying from my intended path, specifically in order to attain a good viewpoint from which to take in the sunset. From this vantage point, I can look out in all directions. All around, what meets my eye is only the wilderness, extending towards the hazy distance. I am unfamiliar with this landscape, and at first, as I survey the scene, I am unable to make sense of it, or decide where I should go next. In the immensity and seemingly infinite extent of the landscape, I feel small, insignificant. To the south-I am orienting myself by the setting sun--lie the meadows where, moments previously, I unexpectedly came across a flock of chickens in the tall grass. To the north, at the end of the valley, a peak towers over the landscape. It would offer an excellent view down into the next valley; perhaps there might be something interesting there. I can trace out a path along the valley floor that would lead me straight to the peak, and so I decide to make my way there before nightfall. My newfound purpose and orientation and my capacity to act meaningfully within the landscape grant me a newfound confidence as I set off on my journey.},

R. R. Tolkien, it traces fantasy media from the birth of the genre to the present day to discuss how exclusion is remediated, normalized, and justified. It challenges the racism of the ``historical accuracy'' fallacy and details how very old sexist literary tropes are continually remediated into contemporary fantasy video games. It asks: What can past discourses surrounding diversity in fantasy media tell us about the resistance to diversity in video games in the present?},

  year = 2022,
  address = {Copenhagen, Denmark},
  abstract = {Quantitative research conducted in cognitive and social sciences has yet to settle on specific methods of managing the digital game as a behavioral stimulus. Consequently, studies and their results are often confronted by criticism of their internal and ecological validity, and the size and generalizability of the results. The current work starts with the exploratory question `What role does the video game have in experimental research studies?' intending to understand current practices, the reasoning behind their use, and their drawbacks. This exploratory question informs the parameters of this game analysis framework , specifically in terms of scope.Previously developed frameworks have generally conceptualized the video game as a stimulus, with varying degrees of determination on the player's behavior. The heterogeneity of games, and their variety, impose a resistance to this conceptualization that results in threats to the validity of the studies. As a response to this, this framework seeks to reframe the video game from a stimulus to a situation. We speak of a stimulus when we are interested in a specific object of the organism's attention or response pattern. A situation, however, is defined by who the participants are, the location, and the type of activity or activities that are taking place. This reconceptualization appears to relate more closely to the procedure of the player engaging with the game and thus appears as a viable and productive avenue of exploration.This leads to the second general question of the thesis, `What is a game situation?' While research into psychological situations is broad, knowledge and concepts cannot be transferred wholesale to the constructed environments of games. The instantiation of the `who', `what' and `where' in the case of the game situation must be established, in order to understand what a game situation is. Relying on ecological psychology, and particularly the concept of affordances, the current framework settles on game objects as the building blocks of the situation. Game objects are considered to be instantiations of game rules, transporting and modifying the agency of the situation participants that act on and through them. Game objects are linked by their complementary disponibilities (e.g., an avatar that can grab, can do so with a grabbable box), forming networks that represent the momentary game situation. Thus, this reconceptualization considers the game system and the player as two participants in a situation, determined by the momentary configuration of perceivable game objects.The perspective of the game environment as an object network allows for multiple avenues of exploration of the player's engagement with the game, both on a macro and micro level. On the macro level, observations about the most influential and influenced objects, for example, can provide information regarding the manner through which the player may exercise control in the engagement and how the game system challenges that control. Such an examination can also provide insights into similarities between games that belong to different genres, and differences between apparently similar games. In this way, it provides a verifiable means of tracing types of game engagement, starting from a unified common ground -- the game object and its relations. On the micro-level, the framework provides a means of examining momentary object configurations - the aforementioned game situations. This answers the requirements presented at the beginning, of providing a means of selecting and controlling the limited engagement between the player and the game during an experimental study. The focus on momentary interactions respects the heterogeneous nature of games and allows equivalences to be made across such momentary interactions and not the games as a whole.While presenting trace characteristics of the domain of origin, particularly in its focus on momentary engagements, the framework is a generative tool, that by virtue of the small scale of its constituent parts, the game objects, and their verifiability, can act as a common ground for the systemic analysis of games.},

Apart from formal archives holding art of this kind, there are also artworks which exist outside these web based institutions. In what way can they be regarded as archived? In the article, criteria are suggested which can be used to judge whether an artwork is active or archived and these criteria are applied in the analysis of twelve different artworks. Different kinds of dating are important for how the status of a work is perceived by the visitor. The concepts of explicit and implicit archiving are used to characterize archiving of Internet art, where works can be "dead" and "alive" at the same time.},

Using extensive film clips from the Star Wars saga, the discussion explores how the continuing battle between the forces of light and darkness is best waged when we believe in a force greater than ourselves. Lucas says that Star Wars is ultimately about a quest for personal transformation and that key to this journey is a deep faith and an appreciation for friendship, honor, and trust.},

The twolimitations of this approach arebias towards the 'main' version of the game, RuneScape3, and the lack of direct comparative ethnography through participant observation.However, comparative ethnography by proxy was achieved through the structure of interviews. The main findings of the study are that the overall community of RuneScape is like that of a nation, with an 'imagined' notion of itself. In actuality the community is fragmented intothematic sub-community groups catalysing aroundthe RuneScapeclan system,whichclosely parallelscommunitiesof practice structures. Players are bound to these communities and RuneScape as a whole through a messy assemblage of bondage, comprising of gameplay and social bonds. Therefore, RuneScape,as an MMORPG,is not addictivein and of itself, because of a mix of gameplay and social factorsbinding players to it. Game designers need to appreciate that MMORPGs represent messy assemblagescombining gameplay and social elements, meaning that changes they make impact on players lives.},

As planetary conditions optimal to the survival of the human species are undergoing profound transformation, the question of what future awaits the human species has become both prominent and pervasive. Extending into the speculative art of video games, this post-apocalyptic mis-en-scene today constitutes something of a familiar reference point for gamers, who might find in such popular games as Left 4 Dead (2008) and Gears of War (2006) a particular speculation on survival where life as we know it encounters the destructive forces of nuclear devastation, epidemic, invasion, or any one of a myriad catastrophic scenarios now clich\'e in the medium. Yet, the ways that video games think survival nevertheless constitutes a speculative fulcrum on which is dramatized both ``world without-us'', or rather, an impersonal hostile world unremitting to the desires of `man', and the human that might survive it (Thacker, 2011). Significant amongst such speculative games are the massive post-apocalyptic worlds of Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 4, each of which evokes the question of how we might survive after nuclear catastrophe and its transformation of the planet into a foreboding ecology populated by mutated animals, radioactive dead-zones, loosely organized bandit hordes, and nomads foraging the resource scarce post-apocalyptic future.},

Informed by theories of motivated reasoning and message design, a meta-analytic review was undertaken to examine the effectiveness of fact-checking in correcting political misinformation (k = 30,N = 20,963). Fact-checking has a significantly positive overall influence on political beliefs (d = 0.29), but the effects gradually weaken when using ``truth scales,'' refuting only parts of a claim, and fact-checking campaign-related statements. Likewise, the ability to correct political misinformation with fact-checking is substantially attenuated by participants' preexisting beliefs, ideology, and knowledge. The study concludes with a discussion of the fact-checking literature in light of current gaps and future opportunities.},

New online platforms have given users opportunities to practice governance through content moderation roles. The over 2.8 million ``subreddit'' communities on Reddit are governed by hundreds of thousands of volunteer moderators, many of whom have no training or prior experience in a governing role. While moderators often devote daily time to community maintenance and cope with the emotional effects of hate comments or disturbing content, Reddit provides no compensation for this position. Thus, moderators' internal motivations and desire to continue filling this role is critical for their community. Drawing upon the relationship between governance procedures and internalized motivation, we investigate how the processes through which subreddit moderators generate community rules increase moderators' motivation through the meeting of social-psychological needs: Procedural Justice and Self Determination, and Self-Other Merging. Preliminary analysis of survey data from 620 moderators across Reddit shows a correlation between moderators' administrative behaviors and the social-psychological needs underpinning their motivations. Understanding these relationships will allow us to empower moderators to build engaging and cooperative online communities.},

One of the key features of this genre is a realistic open world space for the players to explore, to the extent that some even deemed it as the prototype of virtual world and the Metaverse. However, in comparison with the growing world size, the player's spatial experience is a downward spiral. Interaction in an ever-increasing game space suffered from a repetitive design pattern which rendered the world grandeur on the surface but hollow deep down. How to find meaning in this seemingly hollow world and what game designers can learn from it? From a phenomenological perspective, this paper distinguishes ``place'' from ``space,'' and, according to this, proposes a three-dimensional meaning structure of place, that is ``orientation-identification-time,'' as a design approach to reconstruct a meaningful spatial experience in the game world.},

This shifts attention away from questions such as whether agency is ``free will'' (it is not) and toward questions such as how works evoke the desires agency satisfies, employ computational models in the service of player action and ongoing dramatic probability, use interfaces and mediation to encourage appropriate audience expectation, shift from initial audience expectation to an understanding of the computational model, and can be shaped with recognition of the inherently improvisational nature of agency.

To this end, we have conducted an online survey, where respondents were asked to classify and describe NPCs. Furthermore, we also examined recordings of NPCs in games. These data sources were analysed using a model for NPC social believability in order to describe the effects of NPC behaviour in relation to how different types of NPCs are perceived as being believable. Based on this we were able to construct a model of NPC believability, which describes the NPC's level of complexity and ability to handle a mutable social context. As described by the model, NPCs are currently less capable of handling changing social contexts. They do, however, show promise, and given current emerging technologies it is feasible that new types of more socially capable NPCs will arise within the near future.},

In our article, we discuss the decisions that informed the design of the local ``clones'' of the British computer, and how both endeavors were supposed to solve specific problems identified by the communities involved in their design. We argue that different configurations of power---in which the actors that took part in the design of both computers were embedded---were the primary reason why these similar products, the ZX Spectrum clones, were ``scripted'' in a substantially different manner. The Junior was designed as an ``educational computer'' envisaged as an aid to schooling, while the Gama was a more flexible ``home computer.'' Our investigation focuses on how their designers projected, or ``scripted,'' possible forms of computer use, and who they imagined would be the users of these machines. We also compare both computers with the high-profile One Laptop Per Child project to demonstrate the wider relevance of our study and the usefulness of our investigative toolset to the intersection of design studies and science and technology studies.},

While game scholars put more and more focus on the new types of casual games that concentrate mostly on starting discourses on mental health, trauma and the experiences of marginalized people (often referred to as `empathy games'), the discussion would benefit from the introduction of the concept of coziness and the use of more precise definitions. The article discusses cozy aesthetics, showing that their popularity correlates with sociopolitical changes especially in Europe and the United States. First, cozy games are defined in the context of feminist and inclusive design. Second, it proposes three types of application of coziness in games depending on their relationship with functionality: coherent, dissonant and situational.},

The article proposes a concept of dark cozy games to describe those titles that introduce visual softness and, to some degree, ludic safety to horror or Gothic, using three examples to illustrate different ways in which that can be achieved: Cult of the Lamb, Dredge, and Oxenfree.},

He finds the "signature" formula for the myth--the divine hero who slays the serpent or overcomes adversaries--occurs in the same linguistic form in a wide range of sources and over millennia, including Old and Middle Iranian holy books, Greek epic, Celtic and Germanic sagas, down to Armenian oral folk epic of the last century. Watkins argues that this formula is the vehicle for the central theme of a proto-text, and a central part of the symbolic culture of speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language: the relation of humans to their universe, the values and expectations of their society. Therefore, he further argues, poetry was a social necessity for Indo- European society, where the poet could confer on patrons what they and their culture valued above all else: "imperishable fame."},

  abstract = {When we refer to `history' in the context of videogames, what do we mean? At first, this seems a simple question: taking, for example, Space Invaders, we could focus on the design of the game, its arcade release and its ongoing remaking. Yet as games become more complex so do the answers to this question, and scholars have explored not only the history of games as economic and cultural objects but also the ways in which games both present and represent the history of the world around us. Further complexity is added, however, by multiplayer games, particular massively-multiplayer online games (MMOGs) such as World of Warcraft and EVE Online. Should the historian of such games narrate the story of their creation, or of the way they have changed over time, or of the in-game mythologies that set the context in which their players play? Or, perhaps more interestingly, should they recount the stories of the players themselves? This chapter seeks to examine the way in which history is constituted and understood in and around videogames, as economic objects (things made and sold), cultural artefacts (things experienced and emulated) and as social environments (things inhabited and shaped). It considers the ways in which games are historically interesting and the extent to which historicity (historical accuracy) is important in constructing game histories. In closing, it poses questions which may help us to understand more about the social importance of MMOGs and about history itself. Can the most socially developed game worlds be thought of as having credible and complete histories of their own? And if, as Carr observed, our answer to the question `what is history?' reflects our position in time and our view of society, what are the implications of this `videogame history' for the world of 2013?},

Indo-European creation myths, the biblical Genesis, Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Stevenson's Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, and Tolkien's Middle Earth legendaria are examined in support of the thesis that Western literature has recapitulated the mythological notion that the archetypal ancestor possessed a quality and grace that has been slowly lost in time and is represented by a corresponding physical decay. This notion, then, when read as anagogical symbol, serves to furnish society with insights into reiterated social constructs preoccupied with human degeneration and decay, as well as questions about its beliefs concerning humankind's origin, nature, and destiny.},

Drawing on detailed case studies from across the genre, contributors from a variety of backgrounds offer insights into how the study of zombies in the context of video games informs an analysis of their impact on contemporary popular culture. Issues such as gender, politics, intellectual property law, queer theory, narrative storytelling and worldbuilding, videogame techniques and technology, and man's relation to monsters are closely examined in their relation to zombie video games. Breaking new ground in the study of video games and popular culture, this volume will be of interest to researchers in a broad range of areas including media, popular culture, video games, and media psychology"--},

The argument presented here is that although there is a core system of Player versus Player (PvP) which LOTRO shares with other online games, each type of online game has a specific kind of PvP system which attracts players to engage in the gameplay. For instance, the open world sandbox type of PvP attracts certain players to play in LOTRO's PvMP. One of the main aims of this study is thus to investigate some of the core systems of PvP gameplay in open world sandbox PvP. In this article, LOTRO is shown to offer unique opportunities for studying emergent gameplay in open world games, with particular relevance to PvP studies. Two of the core systems of PvP discussed include the design of the simple gameplay rules to support emergent gameplay, and the community's attitudes towards player's behaviours. The types of emergent gameplay discussed include free play versus negotiated fair play, the players' utilisation of strategies in open world PvP to support collaborative and competitive gameplay, and the changing dynamics of open ended gameplay. It is hoped that the analysis provided in this article would form the\- basis of future work on a more general framework for understanding PvP in other online games.},

The present study recruited 5,777 American adults and applied self-determination theory to examine how motivational factors influence, and are influenced by, IGD and health across a six month period. Following a preregistered analysis plan, results confirmed our hypotheses that IGD criteria are moderately stable and that they and basic psychological need satisfaction have a reciprocal relationship over time. Results also showed need satisfaction promoted health and served as a protective factor against IGD. Contrary to what was hypothesized, results provided no evidence directly linking IGD to health over time. Exploratory analyses suggested that IGD may have indirect effects on health by way of its impact on basic needs. Implications are discussed in terms of existing gaming addiction and motivational frameworks.},

Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills--and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit--he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?" --},

The Anglosphere's origins lie in the British Empire and the conflicts of the 20th century. It encompasses an extensive but ill-defined community bonded by language, culture, media, and 'civilisational' heritage founded on the shared beliefs and practices of free-market economics and liberal democracy. Supporters of the Anglosphere argue that it provides a better 'fit' for English-speaking countries at a time when global politics is in a state of flux and under strain from economic crises, conflict and terrorism, and humanitarian disasters.This edited volume provides the first detailed analyses of the Anglosphere, bringing together leading international academic experts to examine its historical origins and contemporary political, social, economic, military, and cultural manifestations. They reveal that the Anglosphere is underpinned by a range of continuities and discontinuities which are shaped by the location of its five core states. The volume reveals that although the Anglosphere is founded on a common view of the past and the present, it continually seeks to realise a shared future which is never fully attained. The volume thus makes an important contribution to debates about the future of the UK outside of the EU, and the potential for the English-speaking peoples to shape the 21st century.},

In the game \emph{The Binding of Isaac}, Isaac runs away from his parent, `Mom', and fights back, which contrasts significantly with the passive and silent Isaac of the biblical text. The interactivity and immersion created by a video game medium has a significant impact on a player's interpretation of the biblical story. This article argues that the video game depicts the Aqedah as horrific as a means to critique corporal punishment as used in some conservative Christian child-rearing strategies. Unfortunately, the game's misogynistic portrayal of Isaac's mother is deeply problematic, which this article also addresses.},

Archaeologists often interpret such finds as indicators of rank and hierarchy among Pleistocene hunter-gatherers. Interpretations of this kind are difficult to reconcile with the view, still common in sociobiology, that pre-agricultural societies were typically egalitarian in orientation. Here we develop an alternative model of `Palaeolithic politics', which emphasizes the ability of hunter-gatherers to alternate -- consciously and deliberately -- between contrasting modes of political organization, including a variety of hierarchical and egalitarian possibilities. We propose that alternations of this sort were an emergent property of human societies in the highly seasonal environments of the last Ice Age. We further consider some implications of the model for received concepts of social evolution, with particular attention to the distinction between `simple' and `complex' hunter-gatherers.},

Using Jesper Juul's oft-cited argument about video games' ``incoherent'' fictional worlds as an example, this essay illustrates the ways that the presumption of video games' radical difference from other media can limit the interpretation of fiction and narrative within games. Using examples from film and television, and key concepts from film and television studies, this essay revisits Juul's assessment of fiction in Donkey Kong -- his exemplar of fictional incoherence. Where Juul finds a breakdown of fictional and narrative potential intrinsic to the videogame form, this essay takes a comparative approach that attends to the meaning of that classic arcade game's serial narrative structure. In so doing, the essay argues for the value of a more open relationship between the study of videogames and other media, inspired largely by a better understanding of the ways that, like videogames, other media have complex relationships with the narratives and fictions they convey.},

To  discover the hidden roles of others, players must employ indirectness and deception  in their communication. DeepRole, an Avalon-playing AI agent created by MIT  researchers in 2019, can communicate through in-game actions but is unable to  communicate in natural language. We have created Avalocution, a bot that enhances  DeepRole with one-way bot-to-human natural language utterances informed by  DeepRole's internal knowledge representation. We hypothesized that our natural  language interface would produce direct and indirect communication, exhibit human- like behavior, and provide a positive gameplay experience for human players. We  collected survey data from research participants who played Avalon against  Avalocution agents, and the survey data supports our hypotheses. We conclude that  adding Avalocution's simple one-way utterance generation model to DeepRole's  existing decision-making framework captures the nuance of communication required  in Avalon while providing an excellent gameplay experience.},

The supervisor must give the necessary guidance, while the student must be able to take the initiative regarding the performance of the programme. Good communication between the supervisor and the student is necessary throughout, but especially at the start the expectations of both parts must be clarified and agreed. This paper seeks to describe some of the main elements of the supervision process. These include finding the right person, matching of expectations, project planning, meeting activities, optimising the research environment, and text production. The paper also describes some ways in which problems can be avoided and also, if they do arise, how these can be solved. In all cases, these questions are addressed both from the supervisor's and the student's point of view. The paper underlines that the supervision is a two-way process that continually needs to be nurtured.}

More broadly expressed, the collection looks at the social, ceremonial and material contexts of myths.

However, discussions around materiality, in a more general sense, have for a long time been significant for historians of religion, especially archaeologists. Myth, Materiality, and Lived Religion seeks to make the case for the relevance of materiality to literary historians and philologists as well. Questions relating to the theme of materiality and lived religion are posed in this book, including: {$\bullet$} What do myths tell us about the material culture of the periods in which they were narrated? {$\bullet$} What role did myths or mythical beings play in connection to, for instance, illnesses and remedies during the Viking Period and the Middle Ages? {$\bullet$} How did ordinary people experience participation in a more formal sacrificial feast led by ritual specialists?

The distinction between what is true in a work of fiction and what is true in a game of make-believe has a special relevance in the context of fictional incompleteness. Specifically, one might object that forced choice incompleteness is not distinctive of interactive fiction since it is found in a particular range of traditional fictions, namely, those that are incomplete with respect to matters of genre classification.},

The results show a systematic over-representation of males, white and adults and a systematic under-representation of females, Hispanics, Native Americans, children and the elderly. Overall, the results are similar to those found in television research. The implications for identity, cognitive models, cultivation and game research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Based on a qualitative analysis of 99 different digital games, this study develops a framework for understanding the functionality and relationships between player objects and virtual environments, explored in what has been named the PO-VE framework. The PO-VE framework encompasses a general theory, a dedicated terminology, and an analysis model. A virtual environment is a navigable geometry and a computational, relational model that represents the relative positions and functions of objects within it. Based on a relational and functional approach, objects are conceived of as integrated in the virtual environment by being spatially and functionally related to other objects within it, thus emphasising the virtual environment's relational system-structure. Within the virtual environment, player objects constitute the player's point of control. As integrated and movable objects, they consist of attributes (properties such as health, speed, and size) and affordances (possible actions such as running, shooting, and jumping). In most cases, player objects are dynamic (i.e., their attributes and affordances are altered over time); they can not only move along a single axis, but also be used for navigating the virtual environment along multiple axes; and they have some sort of visual presentation, which varies according to the specific visual framing of the player object and the virtual environment. The PO-VE framework results from an analysis and iterative coding process of 99 digital games. The games were chosen using a purposive sampling method guided by a pre-conceptualisation of what constitutes an avatar-based game (the initial focus of the study), popular game examples from game studies literature, and certain diversity labels: year of publication, platform, and country of origin. The PO-VE framework thus results from observational data iteratively translated into codes from games published between 1978 and 2018, across 32 different platforms, developed in 17 different countries. The iterative data collection and coding process, which resembled to some extent that of grounded theory, was finally conceptualised into the PO-VE framework, consisting of a general theory of virtual environments as relational systems, a terminology of player objects in virtual environments, and an analysis model that consists of seven categories related to different aspects of PO-VE relations. To illustrate the applicability of the PO-VE model, two levels of application were employed. The first was a broad analysis of the 78 of the 99 games in the sample that meet the player object definition, which reveals general trends and patterns according to types, genres, and production year of games. The second were close readings of ten chosen games from the sample: Space Attack, Altered Beast, Passage, Hotline Miami, Subway Surfers, ZombiU, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, Papers, Please, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Reigns: Her Majesty, that each illustrate the depth of the PO-VE framework, while also clarifying some of the limitations of the framework, including how and why some games, such as Papers, Please and Reigns: Her Majesty, cannot be analysed using the PO-VE framework. The relational foundation of the PO-VE model offers a unique and descriptive approach to analytical game studies that utilises a functional understanding of the digital object. This enables a focus on the environment as a relational system and on integration within it, rather than, for example, on rules, goals, or player experiences. Utilising an OOA/D inspired terminology in the analytical framework is a step towards bridging the gap between humanities-based, theoretical game studies, more technical game studies, and game development. This study is thus a contribution to the most fundamental level of any research endeavour: attempting to map out (parts of) the research object and develop a language that facilitates closer inspection and ultimately a better understanding of digital games and virtual environments.},

Rather, few scholars have investigated how an analysis of the source code can inform a hermeneutic reading of the game. In this paper I will present a reading of the source code of Passage (Rohrer, 2007), argue for why a traditional focus on authorial intention is unnecessary when investigating the symbolism and metaphors of a game, and illustrate how source code analysis can inform the formal analysis of the executed game. Finally, I shall discuss how the source code relates to the game as a `work', and how it can be used for studies of symbolism and metaphors. Thus, I will conclude that it is indeed a valuable method for game studies, although further studies should expand on the textual relation between executed game and source code.},

Likewise, analytical frameworks for understanding digital games tend to overlook rumble as a significant component of the game object or experience. Building on analyses of nine games from the PlayStation family of home consoles, this paper explores rumble as a two-level semiotic structure, consisting of a feedback source and (a) level(s) of operation. The two components are suggested as the base for a typology that accounts for the specific feedback source -- environment, object, interface, or body -- and its specific levels of operation as ludic, dramatic, technical, or an overlap of any of these. We present examples of each type to discuss the uses, applications, and limitations of the framework in relation to both analysis and design.},

Civilization (I -- V), Age of Empires (I -- IV), Anno (5 pts.), Monkey Island (5 pts.), Total War (7 pts.), Assassin's Creed (I -- IV), to name but a few, are heavily serialized in that they all, save for their respective first incarnations, point continuously to the other titles in their series', be it on a structural level or with regard to content. That they do so has many reasons that are totally unconnected with everything they represent, economic ones foremost, but also the need to meet genre- and audience-imposed expectations as well as technical limitations. This aside, given that players who liked one in a bundle are likely to play the rest also, the mere factuality of the series carries implications for the content worth mentioning. First, semiotically such a set of game titles is aptly described in Deleuze/Guattari-terms as an instance of the paranoid-despotic regime of signs,~where signs signify nothing but other signs, bound up in an endless virtual cycle. And second, philosophically this may be taken as a prime instance of the Nietzschean `eternal recurrence of all things'.~Both readings converge in the implication that as these games' series seemingly stage `history', they unlink history and temporality, installing a chron-alogical~framing. Thus, they effectively replave in themselves any factual history as the concept is traditionally understood in Western discourse since the middle of the 19th century with affective historicity. In this, they may reflect (as other media featuring historical content as literature, film, TV, radio, comics, re-enactment, `living history', LARP etc.) popular demands not satisfied by academia, or foreshadow a conceptual transition as part of the digital revolution. Time will tell -- if this will still be possible, then.},

  abstract = {Despite some remarkable shifts in gender demographics of game players during the last decade, computer games remain male-gendered media. Engagement in such a culture, this work suggests, is characterised by confusion and incoherence for women players who are simultaneously taking part in male dominated leisure which marginalises them and a society which assumes gender equality as an acquired right. Small-scale ethnography tied together with an analysis of concurrent cultural discourses and the game system's characteristics allows a deep analysis of the construction of identities that conflict with the naturalised idea of a player. The Sims 2 (2004) computer game sets out a unique case for a study of women's player identities because it is both exceptionally popular among women and individuated by a theme and a structure that are understood as 'feminine'. Furthermore, a group of women players whose engagement with the game is characterised by creation and sharing of new and altered game content, the skinning of it, appears interesting since the women skinners resist traditional gender roles by taking active, productive positions towards the game. This work's original contribution to knowledge is in offering a nuanced view of female game playing which resists easy assimilation to some of the dominant concepts recently in play within the field of study, such as political resistance in the form of game content appropriation and female empowerment through video game play. While skinners seem to have a possibility to change a game that results from a male-dominated game development culture, their skinning is fundamentally facilitated and invited by the game they play. Such practice therefore appears different from the 'high' forms of subversive user-participation that are typically cherished in the studies of media use. Consecutively, the approach in this thesis questions the straightforwardly embracing undertone of the current Web 2.0 'buzz' that claims democratisation of media production. The Sims 2 skinning offers an example of a productive practice that does not go beyond what we understand as gameplay, but demands revisiting the very notion of gameplay itself.},

Although the video-game industry designed these sophisticated simulations to be played by a single participant rather than a large group, the author created a simple set of rules that allows students to run them collectively. This article examines five factors for which an instructor must account if games such as SimCity are to have educational value.

Reflecting the affordances of contemporary technology and the psychological underpinnings of social influence, Crystallization suggests that social media facilitates information produced or relayed by the members of our social networks, who become neo agenda setters. People's perceptions of reality will develop through their social networks and everyone will perceive that the information their social network produces reflects reality, but at the macro level, we will see an ever-diverging cacophony of socially constructed realities.},

As the earlier version has been much used by me, both as a teaching aid and for personal reference, I can attest that this new edition does indeed take the topic forward. Segal makes the point that the study of modern myth is linked to the context of the social sciences such as sociology, anthropology, and psychology where, despite the different emphases, the study of myth is united by questions about its origins, function, and subject matter (1--2). Throughout, the well-known myth of Adonis is used to illustrate the different ways in which mythic theories analyse and derive meaning from their material. The volume considers various mythic theories in relation to areas such as science, philosophy, religion, ritual, literature, psychology, and politics. There is a chapter devoted to structuralist myth, and a concluding foray into what might be called mythic ecology.},

  abstract = {The 2017 video game Horizon Zero Dawn represents a unique version of post-apocalypse, one thousand years after a planet-wide environmental collapse caused by out-of-control technologies. The game's protagonist, Aloy, must fight increasingly aggressive machines made in the image of earth's megafauna as well as the narrow-minded societies of the new earth. Her quest is both a journey of personal discovery and for the betterment of her community, and coupled with her role as a female video game protagonist---which are few and far between---she represents both gender progress and ecological thinking, making her, I argue, an ecofeminist protagonist. Game reviewers, players, and critics have also praised Horizon Zero Dawn for its beautiful graphics, which depict the American West and Southwest. Significantly for an environmental reading, the plot involves scientists creating an AI to terraform Earth's destroyed environments: the AI is named GAIA, invoking James Lovelock's Gaia Theory, and thus the game pits nature against technology at the same time that it figures the two as deeply intertwined and presents players with another female figure to consider in relation to ecological themes. This video essay discusses whether Horizon Zero Dawn depicts the world as it ``should'' be in terms of either gender or ecology, according to ecofeminist theories, and whether Aloy represents an intersectional character according to theorists Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge. If so, this game could be interpreted as activist in more than just a feminist way. The game's message of maintaining hope through personal and cultural hardship through strategies both violence-based and based in ethics of care---for others regardless of ethnicity, for the environment---is much-needed in these precarious political times.},

The term describes the assemblage of social media platforms, autonomous agents, algorithms, and big data tasked with the manipulation of public opinion. Our research shows that this new mode of interrupting and influencing communication is on the rise around the globe. Advances in computing technology, especially around social automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence mean that computational propaganda is becoming more sophisticated and harder to track at an alarming rate. This introduction explores the foundations of computational propaganda. It describes the key role that automated manipulation of algorithms plays in recent efforts to control political communication worldwide. We discuss the social data science of political communication and build upon the argument that algorithms and other computational tools now play an important political role in areas like news consumption, issue awareness, and cultural understanding. We unpack the key findings of the nine country case studies that follow---exploring the role of computational propaganda during events from local and national elections in Brazil to the ongoing security crisis between Ukraine and Russia. Our methodology in this work has been purposefully mixed, we make use of quantitative analysis of data from several social media platforms and qualitative work that includes interviews with the people who design and deploy political bots and disinformation campaigns. Finally, we highlight original evidence about how this manipulation and amplification of disinformation is produced, managed, and circulated by political operatives and governments and describe paths for both democratic intervention and future research in this space.},

Given the similarities of genre (historical/high fantasy) and audience (indicated by nudity, violence and profanity), comparisons were quickly drawn. Game of Thrones earned criticism for the `sexist' outcomes for some of its female characters, and so early analysis of The Witcher often evaluated its female representation and feminist values. This chapter argues that the female representations in season one of The Witcher offers prominent female characters who are imbued with agency, institutional power and well-developed narrative arcs. These representations are somewhat at odds with some initial reaction to the show as sexist. Notably, it uses a dialectic approach to women who are framed by males as villainous (as Stregobor characterizes Renfri in `The End's Beginning'). However, the spectator positioning challenges this through devices such as its unrestricted, non-linear narrative structure. Nevertheless, The Witcher encodes female characters with power as `other', enhancing this otherness through magical abilities. Its archetypal male protagonist further emphasizes the difference of the female deuteragonists, placing him at various times in opposition to characters such as Ciri, Yennefer and Calanthe. This chapter also considers the issues of intersectionality in relation to Yennefer, whose transformative narrative arc has provoked ableist criticism, and how her representation is also impacted by the racial discourse in the series. Through textual analysis and with reference to relevant folkloric, feminist and media scholarship, this chapter interrogates the representations the significant women of The Witcher through the lenses of gendered authorship, essentialist `female' concerns, such as motherhood, the dynamics of the gaze and the varieties of responses to the female characters evident in online discourse.},

The study observed the following: young Chinese women often configure their AI companions as hegemonic men and engage in romantic relationships with them. Meanwhile, leveraging the user's power afforded by generative AI and media platform, they are redefining masculinity through interactive storytelling, while embedding ``obedience'' within hegemonic masculinity; thus, they reverse the male dominance model that is inherent in hegemonic masculinity and generate the AI boyfriend's hybrid masculinity. The hybrid-masculinity concept highlights the tension between the emotional dilemmas faced by women in actual world and their interactive agency within FAII, as well as young Chinese women's re-negotiating gender norms through AI Chat apps.},

It tackles two crucial questions: first, how does war transition from being traumatic to entertaining in the public imagination and works of popular culture; and second, how does visitation to war-related sites transition from being an act of mourning or commemorative pilgrimage into an act of devotion or fan pilgrimage? Representing the collaboration of ten expert researchers of Japanese popular culture and travel, it develops a theoretical framework for understanding war-related contents tourism and demonstrates the framework in practice via numerous short case studies across a millennium of warfare in Japan including: the tales of heroic deities in the Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters, AD 712), the Edo poetry of Matsuo Basho, and the Pacific war through lens of popular media such as the animated film the Grave of the Fireflies. This book will be of interest to researchers and students in tourism studies and cultural studies, as well as more general issues of war and peace in Japan, East Asia and beyond"--},

Permanent memory is implemented using irreversible recombinases that invert the orientation of a unit of DNA, corresponding to the [0,1] state of a bit. To expand the memory capacity, we have applied bioinformatics to identify 34 phage integrases (and their cognate attB and attP recognition sites), from which we build 11 memory switches that are perfectly orthogonal to each other and the FimE and HbiF bacterial invertases. Using these switches, a memory array is constructed in Escherichia coli that can record 1.375 bytes of information. It is demonstrated that the recombinases can be layered and used to permanently record the transient state of a transcriptional logic gate.},

It is deeply inspired by Chinese history and culture, while its heroic backstories have been criticized for potential distortion of historical views. Drawing upon Systemic Functional Linguistics, this study explores the reconstruction in ideational and interpersonal meanings through comparing heroic stories with historical accounts. It reveals that HOK game stories have (1) significantly reconstructed activity processes while largely preserved spatial circumstances; (2) partly fabricated social relationships among characters, which result in the distortion of historical timeline; (3) retained core judgements on characters. It further explains how the reconstruction of heroic stories is embedded in the social context of game discourse, as far as entertainment, sociality, and cultural identity are concerned. The findings may shed light on discourse semantic interpretation in game studies and provide pertinent suggestions for future in-game story writing. \copyright{} The Author(s) 2022.},

  abstract = {Digital games propagate mythical stories and revitalize medieval legends. Amplification of gothic elements in contemporary media and in digital games reflects an ideological and aesthetic transformation of cultural products in contemporary society. This essay discusses distinctiveness in game narratives by citing diverse theories, including semiotics and theories of psychoanalysis, as well as mythology and theology. Game narratives tend to deconstruct the conventional timeframes of chronological order seen in the narratives of traditional literature. Contrary to the formulaic structure of mythology described by Joseph Campbell, digital games introduce a new dimension of time in narratives akin to biblical apocalypse. Digital games deploy synchronic time, exclusively in the form of the present tense, which Tillich identifies as relating to kairos contingent on Heidegger's notion of time. At their forefront, digital games visualize elements of literary stories as a result of deploying synchronic time in reimagined narratives. While digital games attract users via this new concept of transformative time and their visual embellishment of mysticism, innovative narratives in digital games function as a new means of ideology, resonating with the social psychology of users under the challenges of the contemporary world.},

Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire and his employment of the structural demands and thematic aptitudes of his chosen genre. Examining Martin's approaches to his obligations and licenses as a fantasist, Young persuasively argues that the power of A Song of Ice and Fire derives not from Martin's abandonment of genre convention, as is sometimes asserted, but from his ability to employ those conventions in ways that further, rather than constrain, his authorial program. Written in clear and accessible prose, George R. R. Martin and the Fantasy Form is a timely work which encourages a reassessment of Martin and his approach to his most famous novels. This is an important work for both students and critics of Martin's work and argues for a reading of A Song of Ice and Fire as a wide-ranging example of what modern fantasy can accomplish when employed with an eye to its capabilities and purpose.},

Taking algorithms as a prime case to investigate how people respond to datafication in everyday media use, we ask how people perceive positive and negative consequences of algorithms. To answer our question, we conduct qualitative thematic analysis of open-ended answers from a 2019 representative survey among Norwegians, identifying five folk theories: algorithms are confining, practical, reductive, intangible, and exploitative. We situate our analysis in relation to different application of folk theory approaches, and discuss our findings in light of emerging work on perceptions of algorithms and critiques of datafication, including the concept digital resignation. We conclude that rather than resignation, digital irritation emerges as a central emotional response, with a small but significant potential to inspire future political action against datafication.},

Individual chapters survey the perspectives, concepts, and findings on RPGs from key disciplines, like performance studies, sociology, psychology, education, economics, game design, literary studies, and more. Other chapters integrate insights from RPG studies around broadly significant topics, like transmedia worldbuilding, immersion, transgressive play, or player--character relations. Each chapter includes definitions of key terms and recommended readings to help fans, students, and scholars new to RPG studies find their way into this new interdisciplinary field.},

On the level of the storyworld, characters and the narrative universe are endowed with a temporal extension into past and present beyond the scope of the main story line, which increases player immersion. On the meta-narrative plane of possible worlds, the player has considerable control not only over the decisions the main character takes but also the order in which events occur---as such, the player oversees an important part of the narrative itself.},

In the rather short history of Indian game development as compared to other countries---a significant number of games made in India first were produced around 2010---the industry has already lived through big changes and challenges. This article aims at introducing Indian game development and argues that especially independent (so-called indie) game studios in their search for their own, region-specific game development and stand-alone characteristics for Indian games increasingly turn to what they perceive as their own cultural heritage, including, for example, elements from history, art (music, dance, dress styles, and others), and architecture.},

  abstract = {Canadian video game developer BioWare's critically acclaimed Mass Effect video game series has been called the most important science fiction universe of a generation. Whether or not one is inclined to agree, it cannot be denied that Mass Effect matters. It matters not only because of its brilliant narrative and the difficult questions it asks, but also because, as bioethicist Kyle Munkittrick writes, it reflects society as a whole. Mass Effect is a sci-fi epic in the truest sense, spanning over years and across hundreds of planets tucked away in the darkest corners of the galaxy, populated with dozens of species with their own histories, beliefs, cultures, and technologies. Academics and dedicated fans have explored the numerous facets of the game, from its philosophy to time and temporality, fandom ethnographies, and ethics. This article proposes to explore the boundaries of alien sex and the desire for alien others as represented in sci-fi role playing games, and their reinterpretation by fans. Science fiction role playing games in particular enable the production of sexual modalities outside of the constraints of heterosexual norms. Alien sex, animal sex, or monstrous sex are common tropes in fantasy and sci-fi media---the vampire, the werewolf, and monstrous non/in-humans are eroticized and construed conduits of a mainly female sexual desire. However, the example I would like to approach is slightly more radical, both in terms of execution and in terms of media audience response: examples of ``alien sex'' as illustrated in the Mass Effect video game series, whose canonical representation of alien-human romances invite some interesting questions about either the potential exacerbation, or the rendering-unintelligible of sexual difference, as well as about cross-species desire and about the ontology of the natural and the artificial.},

Formal similarities between loot boxes and gambling have led to concerns that they may provide a `gateway' to gambling amongst children. However, the availability of loot boxes is unclear. This study aimed to determine what proportion of top-grossing video games contained loot boxes, and how many of those games were available to children.                                         Design, setting and cases               Survey of the 100 top-grossing games on both the Google Play store and the Apple App store, and the top 50 most-played games on Steam according to the data aggregator SteamSpy.                                         Measurements               The prevalence of loot boxes was measured for each platform outlined above, split by age rating.                                         Findings               A total of 58.0\% of the top games on the Google Play store contained loot boxes, 59.0\% of the top iPhone games contained loot boxes and 36.0\% of the top games on the Steam store contained loot boxes; 93.1\% of the Android games that featured loot boxes and 94.9\% of the iPhone games that featured loot boxes were deemed suitable for children aged 12+. Age ratings were more conservative for desktop games. Only 38.8\% of desktop games that featured loot boxes were available to children aged 12+.

Using a combination of qualitative and computational methods, 140,000 AI-related articles published between 2015 and 2018 were studied. Findings reveal that AI-related discourse on WeChat is surprisingly similar to that on People's Daily Online. That is, it is dominated by industry and political actors, such as government agencies and technology companies, and is mostly characterised by discussions about the economic potential of the technology, with strongly positive evaluations, and little critical debate.},

This study aimed to test the effects of fact-checking labels for misinformation on attitudes toward vaccines. An online survey experiment with 1198 participants recruited from a U.S. national sample was conducted in 2018. Participants were randomly assigned to six conditions: misinformation control, or fact-checking label conditions attributed to algorithms, news media, health institutions, research universities, or fact-checking organizations. We analyzed differences in vaccine attitudes between the fact-checking label and control conditions. Further, we compared perceived expertise and trustworthiness of the five categories of fact-checking sources. Fact-checking labels attached to misinformation posts made vaccine attitudes more positive compared to the misinformation control condition (P = .003, Cohen's d= 0.21). Conspiracy ideation moderated the effect of the labels on vaccine attitudes (P = .02). Universities and health institutions were rated significantly higher on source expertise than other sources. Mediation analyses showed labels attributed to universities and health institutions indirectly resulted in more positive attitudes than other sources through perceived expertise. Exposure to fact-checking labels on misinformation can generate more positive attitudes toward vaccines in comparison to exposure to misinformation. Incorporating labels from trusted universities and health institutions on social media platforms is a promising direction for addressing the vaccine misinformation problem. This points to the necessity for closer collaboration between public health and research institutions and social media companies to join efforts in addressing the current misinformation threat.},

This study focuses on a special SNS discontinuance phenomenon---user exodus. Compared to individual discontinuance behavior studied in prior research, the SNS user exodus possesses its own characteristics: a huge magnitude of users abandon a given SNS product in a very short time. Given the fatal blow of exodus to SNS providers, this exploratory research seeks to unravel why and how the SNS user exodus occurs. Specifically, we conducted a mixed-method research combining laddering interview and network analysis. Drawing on the means-end chain theory, laddering interviews were first used to collect data from discontinuers of a Chinese SNS, Kaixin001, which has experienced a severe user dropout. Then we identified various factors triggering user exodus by content analysis. Last, network analysis was employed to establish the connections between various attributes, consequences, and values. The results showed that user exodus in SNS is strongly related to three types of value: functional, affective, and social value. More important, we also emphasized the dynamics process of exodus by highlighting the role of lurking. Possible contributions and implications of our findings are discussed.},

I argue that the gameplay tasks that we set ourselves, and the patterns of action that they produce, can be understood as a form of `work on the self', and that this work is ambivalent between, on the one hand, an aesthetic transformation of the self -- as articulated by Foucault in relation to the care or practices of the self -- in which we break from the dominant subjectivities imposed upon us, and on the other, a closer tethering of ourselves through our own playful impulses, to a neoliberal subjectivity centred around instrumentally-driven selfimprovement. Game studies' concern with the effects that computer games have on us stands to gain from an examination of Foucault's late work for the purposes of analysing and disambiguating between the nature of the transformations at stake. Further, Foucault's tripartite analysis of `power-knowledge-subject', which might be applied here as `game-discourse-player', foregrounds the imbrication of our gameplay practices -- the extent to which they are due to us and the way in which our own volitions make us subject to power, which is particularly pertinent in the domain of play.},

Drawing attention to the eastern orthodox form of Christianity as the background of Eliade's thinking, the article expresses doubts concerning Eliade's influence. A scholar of Eliade's calibre may `get away' with things that are not necessarily acceptable when rehashed by his epigones.},
